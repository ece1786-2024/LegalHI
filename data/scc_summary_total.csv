2018 SCC 58,"<strong>The mandatory victim surcharge that everyone convicted of a crime has to  pay is unconstitutional, the Supreme Court has ruled. The majority said it was  cruel and unusual punishment, and struck it down.</strong>
   The <em>Criminal  Code </em>says that anyone found guilty of a crime has to pay a “victim  surcharge.” The amount depends on the type of crime. It is 30% of any fine  charged. If there is no fine, it is $100 for every summary conviction count and  $200 for every indictable (pronounced “in-DYE-ta-bull”) count. (These are  different types of charges, with indictable counts being more serious.) The  surcharge has to be paid even if the judge gives the person a “discharge,”  meaning there is no other punishment. The money is meant to help victims. A lot of people who commit crimes are poor. Many live  with addictions or mental health issues. Sometimes they simply can’t pay.  Before 2013, a judge could choose not to make someone pay the surcharge if it  would cause too much hardship. Parliament changed the law in 2013 to say that  judges had to impose it no matter what. They could increase it, but couldn’t  lower it. In hardship cases, the most judges could do was give the person more  time to pay. This case involved seven people appealing four  different decisions in two provinces. In each case, the offenders said they couldn’t  afford the surcharge. One person was ordered to pay $1,400. He was homeless,  addicted, and unemployed, with a yearly income of only $4,800. Another was  ordered to pay $700. He had addiction and mental health issues and had only  $136 each month after food and housing were paid for. Other people had  different physical and mental health issues, and some struggled with  addictions. All lived in poverty. But they were still ordered to pay hundreds  or thousands of dollars. Even judges making the orders said the offenders  couldn’t afford to pay, but their hands were tied. The offenders argued this violated section 12 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  which is part of Canada’s constitution<em>.</em> Section 12 says that “everyone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel  and unusual treatment or punishment.” The lower courts and all judges at the  Supreme Court accepted that the surcharge was “punishment”; the question was  whether it was “cruel and unusual.” “Cruel and unusual” means more than just harsh.  It means punishment so unacceptable and extreme that society shouldn’t allow  it. The Quebec and Ontario Courts of Appeal said the  surcharge wasn’t cruel and unusual punishment and was constitutional. They said  all the offenders had to pay it, while conceding they probably wouldn’t be able  to. The majority at the Supreme Court disagreed. It said the  mandatory victim surcharge was, in fact, cruel and unusual punishment. The  surcharge created a crushing financial burden on very poor people (for them, a  few hundred dollars is more like $23,000 for an average Canadian). People who  couldn’t pay were constantly under threat of being arrested and jailed, even if  only briefly, for not paying. They might also be harassed by collections  agencies. They could end up in court over and over again to explain why they  hadn’t paid, which amounts to public shaming. And the surcharge was basically an  unending punishment, because all of this would continue until it was paid.  Offenders couldn’t apply for a pardon that might allow them to get work and  move forward. The majority said this also burdened the justice system, which spent  more trying to get poor people to pay the surcharge than it would ever get  back. The  majority noted that a sentence works best if it is made for the individual. The  mandatory victim surcharge didn’t allow judges to look at a person’s  circumstances, or the best way to rehabilitate them. It also didn’t make sense sometimes—for  example, five  counts of vandalism would have a higher surcharge than a count of murder.  This decision means that judges can’t order victim  surcharges anymore. It doesn’t mean all victim surcharges ordered in the past  are canceled. When a law is struck down in court, it is struck down  retroactively only for the people who fought the case. But the majority noted  that cruel and unusual punishment happens both when it is imposed and when it  is enforced. A convicted person who was ordered to pay a surcharge before the  law was struck down, but hasn’t, could challenge it when brought to court to  explain the non-payment. "
2018 SCC 56,"<strong>A person who shares an electronic device with someone else can’t waive  the other user’s <em>Charter</em> rights, the Supreme Court  has ruled. Police violated a man’s <em>Charter</em> rights when they took his computer to search it with only his spouse’s  consent.</strong>
   Mr.  Reeves wasn’t allowed to live in the family home after he was charged with domestic  violence. His spouse told Mr. Reeves’ probation officer that the year before,  she thought she’d seen child pornography on the home computer they shared. In  response to this report, a police officer came to the home. He didn’t have a  search warrant, and didn’t think he had enough evidence of a possible crime to  get one. But Mr. Reeves’ spouse let the officer in and signed a form saying he  could take the computer. The  police kept the computer for four months before doing anything. They didn’t  report to a judge or justice of the peace that they had taken it, which the law  said they had to do. When they finally searched it, they used a faulty warrant.  However, they found 140 images and 22 videos of child pornography. Mr. Reeves  was charged. Section  8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em> says that “everyone has the right to be secure against  unreasonable search or seizure.” This means the state can’t search or take  something private without permission, unless the law specifically allows it, like  when police have a warrant. Everyone agreed that the police violated Mr.  Reeves’ <em>Charter </em>rights when they didn’t  report the seizure and when they searched the computer with a faulty warrant.  But Mr. Reeves argued the initial seizure of the computer was also a <em>Charter</em> breach. He said that the violations  were together so serious that the files shouldn’t be allowed into evidence. The  Crown (the prosecution) argued the police were allowed to take the shared  computer because Mr. Reeves’ spouse gave them permission. The  judge who heard the pre-trial argument agreed with Mr. Reeves that the computer  evidence couldn’t be used. Without it, Mr. Reeves  was found not guilty. The Court of Appeal said that, given the  series of <em>Charter </em>breaches, this was  a borderline case, but said the evidence should be allowed. It ordered a new  trial.  All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed with the pre-trial judge that the files shouldn’t  be allowed into evidence. They said the not-guilty verdict should stand.  The  majority said that the police breached Mr. Reeves’ <em>Charter </em>rights by taking the computer without his consent and  without a warrant. An individual who shares a computer with someone else takes  the risk that the other person can access their personal data, and maybe even tell  the police about it. But the law shouldn’t allow the police to take the device  or its data directly, without the individual’s consent or a warrant. When two  people share a personal computer, one can’t consent to its search or seizure on  behalf of the other. Only Mr. Reeves could waive his own <em>Charter</em> privacy rights; his spouse could not. When  deciding if section 8 has been violated, courts balance society’s interest in  protecting personal privacy with its interest in allowing police to enforce the  law. The real question isn’t whether someone broke the law (when charges are  laid, there’s usually evidence that they did). It’s whether the police went too  far in trying to find evidence of a crime. Where a police investigation invades  someone’s privacy in a way that could cause the public to lose confidence in  the justice system, courts won’t allow the evidence to be used. While this may  result in a not-guilty verdict, it is necessary to signal the importance of  protecting the privacy of every Canadian, including those never charged with a  crime. The majority said the police went too far when, along with the two other <em>Charter</em> breaches, the officer took  Mr. Reeves’ home computer without his permission or a warrant.  The  majority didn’t decide if the police officer’s entry into the home was legal,  because it didn’t rule on whether one person can allow the police to enter and search  shared spaces. It wasn’t the central issue in this case. The devices  Canadians use every day, like laptops and cell phones, contain a great deal of private  information. They can also be used to access even more information stored  elsewhere, like in email and social media accounts. This case was important  because it affected the privacy rights of all Canadians in shared devices."
2018 SCC 55,"<strong>Shareholders usually can’t sue when a corporation is harmed, causing their  shares to lose value, the Supreme Court has confirmed.</strong>
     This  case dealt with a complex business structure. Mr. Brunette and Mr. Maynard managed  a trust. The trust owned only one thing: 100% of the shares in a holding  company (a company set up to own shares in <em>other</em> companies). That holding company owned shares in companies together known as  the Groupe Melior, which owned and operated seniors’ homes. In 2009, most of  these companies went bankrupt after they received unexpected tax bills. These  bankruptcies also caused the holding company to go bankrupt. Since the only  thing the trust owned was shares in the holding company, it was now worthless. The  Groupe Melior’s business structure was based on advice from lawyers and  accountants. Mr. Brunette and Mr. Maynard said the lawyers and accountants  didn’t do their jobs properly. They said this caused the surprise tax bills,  which caused the bankruptcies, which led to the complete loss of value of the trust.  They also argued the lawyers and accountants were supposed to tell the trust  about possible problems with the tax structure right away, but didn’t. Mr.  Brunette and Mr. Maynard sued the lawyers and accountants for $55 million on  the trust’s behalf.  The  main issue was whether the trust, represented by Mr. Brunette and Mr. Maynard,  was allowed to sue the accountants and lawyers. Before the trial, accountants  and lawyers asked the court to dismiss the case, arguing Mr. Brunette and Mr.  Maynard clearly had no “interest” to sue. In law, having an interest means that  the issue affects you in a personal and direct way. It is a necessary condition  to have a judge hear your claim in court. If a person being sued thinks that  the person suing them clearly has no interest, they can ask that a judge reject  the lawsuit before a trial takes place. This makes sure that courts don’t waste  time and resources on cases that have no chance of success. In the present  case, the issue was whether the trust had a sufficient interest for the case to  go to trial. The  problem with the claim was that the trust was only a shareholder of the  companies that went bankrupt. In Quebec’s civil law, as well as the common law  used in the rest of Canada, shareholders usually can’t sue for damages to a  company they hold shares in. This is particularly true if the damage results in  a loss in value of their shares. Only the company has the right to sue. This is  in part because the law considers that when damage is done to a company,  shareholders are harmed only indirectly. According to the <em>Civil Code of Quebec</em>, only direct harm can be claimed in court. The  only time shareholders can sue is if the wrongdoer owes them a separate legal  duty than the one owed to the corporation, and that this causes a separate harm  to the shareholders. In order to decide if the trust had an interest that would  give it the right to sue, the court had to decide if the lawyers and  accountants owed it a separate duty and caused it a separate and direct harm. The  trial judge and Court of Appeal agreed that the trust couldn’t sue. The  majority at the Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts. It said the Groupe Melior  corporations were directly harmed, but not the trust. The lawyers and  accountants did not have an obligation to inform and advise the trust about the  Groupe Melior’s tax structure. Also, the trust’s loss was the same as that lost  by the Groupe Melior corporations (the value of the seniors’ homes). It was the  exact same harm, which meant that it couldn’t be claimed by the shareholders,  only by the companies. The majority noted that the business structure was  designed to protect the trust from having to pay the Groupe Melior’s debts. But  this also meant it couldn’t exercise the corporations’ right to sue.  This case came from  Quebec, which uses the civil law. Both systems apply different rules to solve  legal problems. Because they are different, they don’t always end up with the  same result. But often, like in this case, they do.  "
2018 SCC 54,"<strong>In a criminal case, “reasonable” doubt should be based  on evidence, not speculation, the Supreme Court has confirmed.</strong>
     In 2012, Mr. Cyr-Langlois was pulled over on suspicion  of drunk driving. He was taken to a police station, where his blood alcohol  level was tested with a breathalyzer device. Following standard procedure, two  breath samples were taken about 20 minutes apart. The officer who took the  samples didn’t stay in the same room with Mr. Cyr-Langlois to watch him before  each test. Another officer did. Mr. Cyr-Langlois blew over the legal limit for  both samples. He was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and  driving with blood alcohol “over 80” (more than 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of  blood). This appeal was about the “over 80” charge. When the Crown (the prosecution) charges someone with  a crime, it has to prove the person committed the crime beyond a “reasonable  doubt.” This is a very high standard, but it is not absolute certainty (in law,  as in life, very few things can be proven with 100% confidence). If a judge or  jury thinks an accused person is “probably” guilty, they have to find the  person <em>not</em> guilty. “Probably” is not  enough. On the other hand, if a doubt is purely theoretical or imaginary, and  not based on evidence, it is not “reasonable” doubt. This high standard is  important because everyone—even police, lawyers, and judges—can make mistakes.  But mistakes are less likely to happen when this high standard is met. In a drunk driving case, the main evidence against a  person is usually a blood alcohol test. A breathalyzer test is assumed to be trustworthy  (that is, proving drunkenness beyond reasonable doubt) unless the accused person  can show it isn’t. They would have to show evidence that the device may not  have been working properly, or was used incorrectly, <em>and</em> that this could affect the reliability of the results. This  would be reasonable doubt. Unless the Crown had other evidence, the person  would have to be found not guilty. Mr. Cyr-Langlois didn’t argue that the breathalyzer  wasn’t working. He said the police officer didn’t use it properly, because the  procedure wasn’t followed exactly. He said a police officer had to wait and  watch the suspected drunk person for 20 minutes, take a sample, wait 20  minutes, and take a sample again. The reason the officer was supposed to watch  the person was to make sure nothing happened during that time that could affect  the result. For example, burping or throwing up could bring traces of alcohol directly  from the stomach into the mouth, which could change the result. Mr.  Cyr-Langlois said the police officer who took the samples left the room. The  officer wasn’t sure if his colleague had watched Mr. Cyr-Langlois the whole  time. Mr. Cyr-Langlois said this meant the procedure wasn’t followed, so the  test results couldn’t be trusted. He said he should be found not guilty. The summary conviction judge agreed with Mr.  Cyr-Langlois, and found him not guilty. The Crown appealed to the Superior  Court, which cancelled the not-guilty verdict and ordered a new trial. The  Court of Appeal ruled for Mr. Cyr-Langlois, saying the not-guilty verdict  should stand. The majority at the Supreme Court canceled the  not-guilty verdict and said there should be a new trial. Mr. Cyr-Langlois’  arguments were speculation, not reasonable doubt. He didn’t suggest that anything  happened before the two samples that might have made the test less reliable,  like a digestive issue. He argued it was enough that an officer might not have  watched him the whole time, and <em>theoretically</em> something could have been missed. To raise reasonable doubt, he had to show  concrete proof the incorrect use of the breathalyzer could have affected the  results and made them untrustworthy. For example, he could have testified that  he had burped before the samples were taken. He didn’t testify, so it didn’t  matter if an officer was watching him for the whole time or not. This decision was  given from the bench on October 17, 2018. The Court released written reasons  explaining it on December 6, 2018. The Court also released two other decisions  involving breathalyzers about six weeks before this one: <em><a href=""37395-37403-eng.aspx"">R. v.  Gubbins</a></em> and <em><a href=""37207-eng.aspx"">R. v. Awashish</a></em>.  "
2018 SCC 53,"<strong>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld an order for a  journalist to give police copies of conversations with a person who said he  belonged to a terrorist group. </strong>
   In 2014, Vice Media Canada published three stories  about a Canadian man who said he was a member of the so-called “Islamic State”  terrorist group in Syria. The stories were based on conversations one of Vice’s  journalists had with the man through an instant messaging application. Police read  the stories and thought the man was committing serious crimes (participating in  terrorist activities and making death threats). Police wanted to investigate, but the news stories  weren’t enough. Even though the man was identified by name and wanted people to  know what he was doing, they needed hard evidence—like copies of the actual  conversations. But the messaging application the journalist used to talk to the  man didn’t store them. The only way police could get them was from one of the  participants. They asked a judge to order Vice and the journalist to give them copies  of the messages so they could build their case. This kind of order is called a  “production order,” because it forces someone to produce (in the sense of “provide”)  something for someone else.  For most legal issues, judges will hear both sides in  court before making a decision. There are some exceptions where a judge will  hear only one side, such as if the issue is urgent or there is a danger the  evidence could be lost. This happens in an “<em>ex parte</em>” hearing. <em>Ex parte</em> means without the other party being there (and  without them knowing about it). In this case, the police didn’t want Vice to  know they were trying to get the information. They were afraid that Vice might  move it somewhere Canadian courts couldn’t touch it. The judge granted the  order in an <em>ex parte </em>hearing. Later,  when Vice received the order, it said it only had screenshots of the messages.  It didn’t think it should have to give those to police and went to court to  fight it.  At the time Vice went to court, the law said the  order could be canceled only if  no other reasonable judge would have allowed it. Judges can’t look at all  details of all issues from the start and re-analyze them every time. This would  take too long and cost too much. These are some of the reasons higher-court  judges “defer to,” or rely on, lower-court judges’ decisions. They look at what  a reasonable judge might have done, not what decision they might personally  have made. The reviewing judge heard Vice’s arguments but said  it still had to share the screenshots. This was because the original judge’s  decision had a reasonable basis. The Court of Appeal agreed. All  of the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Vice had to give police the  screenshots. They looked at all the factors and said the original judge’s  decision was reasonable. They noted it was important for media to be able to  gather and share news with the public without government interference, and that  it had a special role in society. But, in this case, society’s interest in  investigating and prosecuting crimes outweighed it. The  majority said that while this wasn’t an appropriate case to make major changes  to the rules on media search warrants and production orders, they had to be  tweaked. According to the rules, a judge first has to think about whether it is  best to let the media know about a police request for a warrant or production  order, or to hold a hearing <em>ex parte</em>.  The majority added a slightly modified rule. It said that if a warrant or order  is granted <em>ex parte</em>, the media should  be able to go to court to argue points the original judge didn’t know about. If  these points could reasonably have affected the original judge’s decision,  another judge has to review the whole decision from the beginning (not just  looking at whether it had a reasonable basis). Second, the judge has to make  sure all the conditions listed in the <em>Criminal  Code</em> are met. Specifically, that there is a good chance a crime has been or  will be committed, that the person has the information the police are looking  for, and that the information will provide evidence of the crime. Third, the  judge has to look at all the facts and circumstances. S/he has to balance  society’s interest in investigating and prosecuting crimes against the media’s  right to privacy in gathering and sharing news. Finally, the judge has to think  about ways to make sure the media wouldn’t be overly restricted in carrying out  its work. Applying these updated rules to this case, the majority said the  lower courts were right. The new <em>Journalistic Sources Protection Act</em> became law in 2017. It didn’t apply to this case because the events happened  before it came into force."
2018 SCC 52,"<strong>A person  named as an irrevocable beneficiary of a life insurance policy doesn’t always  have a right to keep the insurance money, the Supreme Court has confirmed. A  third party may have a right to the insurance money if there has been “unjust  enrichment.” </strong>
   Mr. Moore  bought a $250,000 life insurance policy in 1985, while he was married to Ms.  Moore. Ms. Moore was named the sole beneficiary, which means that she would get  the money if Mr. Moore died. The Moores separated in 1999 and divorced in 2003.  Until 2000, the Moores paid the $507.50 premium each year out of their joint bank  account. In 2000, Ms. Moore and Mr. Moore verbally agreed that Ms. Moore would  pay all of the yearly premiums. In exchange, Mr. Moore would keep Ms. Moore on  the policy as the sole beneficiary. From 2000 on, Ms. Moore paid the premiums  herself.  In 2000,  Mr. Moore moved in with Ms. Sweet. Soon after, he made her the “irrevocable”  beneficiary of the policy, even though he had agreed to keep Ms. Moore named as  sole beneficiary. He didn’t tell Ms. Moore that he made this change.  Ontario’s <em>Insurance Act</em> sets out the rules for  insurance policies. It says an insured person can name another person (or group  of people) as the beneficiary of their life insurance policy. That other person  can be named either a “revocable” beneficiary or an “irrevocable” beneficiary. “Revocable”  beneficiaries can be removed from a policy at any time. They don’t have to  agree, or even be informed that they are being removed. Ms. Moore was a  “revocable” beneficiary. “Irrevocable” beneficiaries, like Ms. Sweet, can only  be removed if they agree to it.  Ms. Moore  only found out that she had been removed as the beneficiary when Mr. Moore died  in 2013. At this point, she sued Ms. Sweet for $250,000, the value of the  policy. She argued that Ms. Sweet got a benefit at her expense, and there was  no legal basis for it. This kind of situation is called “unjust enrichment.” Ms.  Moore asked the court to put the money  in a “constructive trust,” a common request when unjust enrichment happens. A  constructive trust means someone has to hold certain property for someone  else’s benefit.  Both Ms.  Moore and Ms. Sweet agreed that the verbal agreement between the Moores was a  contract. The question was whether the <em>Insurance </em><em>Act</em> gave Ms. Sweet legal  basis to keep the money in spite of that. The trial judge ruled in favour of Ms. Moore,  saying Mr. Moore had given her rights to the policy through their verbal  agreement. The Court of Appeal disagreed. It said that while Ms. Moore should  get back all the money she paid for the premiums (about $7,000), Ms. Sweet  should get to keep the rest of the money.  The majority at the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Ms. Moore. The  fact that Ms. Sweet was an irrevocable beneficiary of the policy wasn’t enough  for her to be allowed to keep the money. The <em>Insurance Act</em> set out how beneficiaries could be named, but it  didn’t say that naming a new beneficiary would automatically override other  people’s rights from previous agreements. Courts already said that other people  could have rights to an insurance policy no matter who was actually listed on  it. This could be through a contract or by the concept of “equity” (rules of  fairness). Those people could claim the insurance money on some legal or “equitable”  (fair) basis, like unjust enrichment. The  majority also noted that Ms. Sweet would have received nothing if Ms. Moore  ever stopped paying. For those reasons, the majority said that Ms. Moore should  get the insurance money under a constructive trust. This  case was about what happens when someone has a pre-existing right to an  insurance policy, but someone else is named as the irrevocable beneficiary. The  majority said that in this case, the beneficiary was unjustly enriched and  could not keep the insurance money."
2018 SCC 50,"<strong>The choice to speak either English  or French in certain courts is a protected right, the Supreme Court has  confirmed. When this right is not respected, there might have to be a new hearing.</strong>
   Mr. Mazraani worked as a personal insurance representative for  Industrial Alliance for six months in 2012. His contract said he was  self-employed. When he lost his job, he wanted to apply for Employment  Insurance benefits, but self-employed people aren’t eligible. His case ended up  before the Tax Court of Canada.  Canada has two official languages, English and French. The Constitution  says that people have the right to use either language in certain courts (such  as a court created by Parliament, like the Tax Court). It doesn’t matter how  well a person can speak either language. It’s their choice, and they can change  their mind in the middle of a hearing (that is, a trial, an appeal, or another legal  proceeding) if they want. Language rights are different from the <em>Charter </em>right to understand (and be  understood) during a trial. They are meant to protect official language  communities. Every court has rules of procedure that apply to it. The Tax Court’s  rules said that the parties could say which language they wanted to use in  court and ask for an interpreter if they needed one. But some cases are dealt  with in a less formal way, to save time (and money) for everyone. In these  cases, the usual rules don’t apply. The simplified rules that applied in Mr.  Mazraani’s case didn’t say how someone could tell the court which language s/he  wanted to use. They also didn’t set out how someone could ask for an  interpreter.  When the hearing started, Mr. Mazraani wanted to use English. Industrial  Alliance’s first witness wanted to speak in French. But the judge said they  would have to come back another day when an interpreter was available for Mr.  Mazraani. Industrial Alliance decided not to wait, so the witness spoke in  English. The hearing lasted a few more days and other witnesses who wanted to speak  in French were asked to speak in English. The judge also asked Industrial  Alliance’s lawyer to make his arguments in English, even though he was more  comfortable in French. Even so, many parts of the hearing happened only in  French, and Mr. Mazraani couldn’t understand them. The Tax Court judge ruled Mr. Mazraani was an employee. He criticized  Industrial Alliance’s witnesses as “misleading” and said they played with words  to avoid telling the truth. He said the company acted so badly that it had to  pay Mr. Mazraani’s legal costs. This was to discourage “abuse of process”  (misuse of the courts). Industrial Alliance appealed, saying the judge had violated the language  rights of its witnesses and lawyer. The Federal Court of Appeal agreed. It also  said Mr. Mazraani’s rights were violated because large parts of the hearing were  never translated for him. It ordered a new hearing before a different judge. The Supreme Court unanimously agreed the witnesses’ and lawyer’s  language rights were violated, and that Mr. Mazraani’s were, too. It didn’t  matter that there were no rules about language rights in the simplified Tax  Court procedures. The judge still had to make sure people’s language rights  were protected (especially people coming to court without lawyers, like Mr.  Mazraani). It was wrong for the judge to ask anyone to use a different  language. Every party, witness, and lawyer had to know s/he had a real choice  about what language to use. The Court said that language rights were so  important that there would usually have to be a new hearing when they were  violated, even if the violation didn’t affect the result. In this case, the  violations had a clear effect on the proceedings and the decision, so the Court  ordered a new hearing. This decision noted that breaching  someone’s language rights can be seen as a sign of bias against a language  group. This lowers public trust in our courts, which is one reason it is so  important for judges to protect these rights."
2018 SCC 48,"<strong>The Constitution allows the federal, provincial and territorial  governments to work together to regulate securities trading under a single,  unified system, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Securities  are stocks, bonds, and other financial products. They are often traded on stock  markets by investors. Canada is one of the only developed countries that doesn’t  have a <em>national</em> (that is, a  Canada-wide) regulator to oversee securities trading. This is mostly because of  how the Constitution is written, with powers divided between the provincial and  federal governments. Courts have read the Constitution as saying that only  provinces and territories can make laws about securities trading within their  borders. The federal government can’t make these kinds of laws, but it has  other general powers over trade and commerce. So, in Canada, each province and  territory has its own securities regulator. The  federal government thought financial markets were so important to the Canadian  economy that they should be overseen by a single regulator. In 2011, it asked  the Supreme Court whether Parliament would be allowed to pass a federal law to  do that. The Court said no, because under the Constitution, the provinces and  territories have power over most aspects of securities regulation. The federal  government can’t make laws on issues that belong to the provinces and  territories. The Court said, though, that a <em>cooperative</em> approach could be constitutional. In a cooperative approach, provinces and  territories would deal with aspects of securities regulation within their power,  and the federal government would deal with aspects within its power. Based on this advice, the  governments of Canada, Ontario, B.C., Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, P.E.I., and  Yukon proposed a “Cooperative System” to oversee securities markets across the country. It was made up of a  “draft law” that the federal Parliament could pass, a “model law” that  provincial and territorial legislatures could pass, and a national securities  regulator.<strong> </strong>The system was set out  in an agreement between executive levels of government (that is, the Prime  Minister and Premiers, and their cabinets). Quebec, Alberta, and Manitoba had concerns about the proposal. In  2015, Quebec asked its Court of Appeal to answer two questions about it.  The first was whether the proposed Cooperative System would be permitted by the  Constitution. The second was whether the draft federal law overstepped the  federal government’s general trade and commerce powers. The Court of Appeal answered no to both  questions. The  Supreme Court unanimously answered yes to the first question, and no to the  second question. While the proposal is constitutional, the Court said that each  province and territory has to decide for itself whether it is a good idea to  join. This is a policy choice, not a legal one.  On  the first question, the Court said the Cooperative System is constitutional  because it doesn’t interfere with “parliamentary sovereignty.” Parliamentary  sovereignty is an important constitutional principle. It means that the  legislature (and<em> only </em>the  legislature) can pass, change, and get rid of any laws that it chooses to. Some  provinces argued that the Cooperative System would force provincial and  territorial legislatures to pass the model law, and any changes made to it at a  later date (which would go against parliamentary sovereignty). But the Court  disagreed, and said that any legislature remains free to reject the model law,  or any of its changes, if it wants to. Even though a “Council of Ministers”  would be in charge of approving changes to the Cooperative System, they  wouldn’t have the power to  change any actual laws. If a legislature  disagrees with the Cooperative System or any changes, it could always reject them. For  the second question, the Court said the draft federal law falls within  Parliament’s general powers to regulate trade and commerce, which it has under  the Constitution. But Parliament can only use this power to make laws dealing  with truly national issues, which are issues that provinces and territories  can’t deal with on their own. In this case, the draft federal law was written  very carefully. It focuses on “systemic risk” that could hurt Canada’s economy,  and doesn’t go beyond that. It is meant to work together with provinces’ and  territories’ laws, and doesn’t interfere with their role in securities  regulation.  Finally,  and related to the second question, the Court said it is fine for the federal  government to give the Council of Ministers the power to make federal  regulations on its behalf. Regulations are “secondary rules” made by people or groups  that are given rule-making powers by the legislature. Some of the provinces saw  a problem with Parliament letting a group like the Council of Ministers, made  up mostly of <em>provincial</em> representatives,  be involved in making <em>federal</em> regulations. But the Court doesn’t see a problem with this. Parliament can  choose to delegate power to make federal regulations to other people or groups,  including provincial groups, if it wants to. It can also take that power away, if  it wants to.  This case came to the Supreme Court as an appeal from a provincial  “reference.” References are questions that governments ask courts for their  opinion on. (In law, an “opinion” isn’t just a belief or point of view. It is a  formal explanation of the law.) The federal government can ask the Supreme  Court for a legal opinion on an issue, like it did with the <em>Securities Act</em> <em>Reference</em> in 2011. Provincial and territorial governments can ask  their Courts of Appeal for opinions, too. These opinions can be appealed to the  Supreme Court. This case began as a reference to the Quebec Court of Appeal by  the Quebec government."
2018 SCC 46,"<strong>Courts can’t force parties to renegotiate contracts, the Supreme Court  has confirmed. Unexpected changes in electricity prices didn’t mean that Hydro-Québec  had to share its profits from the Churchill Falls power station.</strong>
     In 1969, after many years of  negotiations, Hydro-Québec and the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation (part  of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro) agreed to build a power station on the  Churchill River. It was a huge and expensive project. Hydro-Québec took on most  of the financial risk in the contract. It agreed to buy most of the electricity  at fixed prices price for 65 years, whether it needed it or not, and to cover  any construction cost overruns. But it got a long-term supply of cheap energy  in return for taking this risk on. The Corporation got a long-term, stable  source of income. That meant it was able to borrow money to build the station,  which in 2018 was worth over $20 billion. By 2009, the price of electricity was  much higher than it had been forty years before. Hydro-Québec was taking  advantage of the low rates and selling electricity to customers outside Quebec  at higher prices. The Corporation didn’t think this was fair. It said it should  be able to share in the profits. In 2010, when Hydro-Québec refused to  renegotiate the contract, the Corporation asked the courts to force it to. In Quebec law, people who sign a  contract together have certain duties toward each other. The province’s <em>Civil Code</em> says that all sides have to treat  each other with “good faith.” That means they have to be honest and not do  anything to hurt each other. As part of this duty, they are sometimes expected  to cooperate. How far the duty goes depends on the kind of contract it is. It  is stronger for a “relational” contract than for a “transactional” one. A  relational contract is based on a long-term, cooperative relationship where  risks and benefits are expected to be shared (like a partnership). A  transactional contract specifically sets out risks and benefits agreed to by  all sides. The Corporation said the contract was relational, so Hydro-Québec had  to share its benefits. Hydro-Québec said it wasn’t a relational contract, so it  didn’t have to share anything. Both the trial court and the Court  of Appeal ruled for Hydro-Québec.  The majority at the Supreme Court  also ruled for Hydro-Québec. It said the trial judge was not wrong to decide  that the contract wasn’t relational, and that Hydro-Québec didn’t have to  renegotiate. The contract set out many things very precisely, which showed both  sides meant to follow the specific wording of the agreement, not to rely on any  ongoing relationship. Good faith didn’t mean Hydro-Québec had to give up the benefits  it had negotiated. Good faith also didn’t mean Hydro-Québec had to renegotiate  just because there was an unexpected change in electricity prices. While Quebec  courts sometimes make a party compromise a bit to find a solution, no court  ever forced parties to renegotiate the key parts of a contract. Also, no court  ever found that a duty to cooperate meant a party had to give up some of its  profits just because the other party wasn’t profiting as much. Finally, the  majority agreed with the trial judge that the Corporation’s claim was too late  anyway. This case dealt with a long-term contract and civil law concepts of good  faith, equity, and unforeseeability. The majority confirmed that courts should  not change contracts or force parties to renegotiate them if this would upset  the balance the parties originally agreed to."
2018 SCC 45,"<strong>Rulings made in the middle  of a criminal case can’t be challenged until after the judgment, even if they  are wrong, the Supreme Court has confirmed. The Court emphasized that the purpose  of this general rule is to avoid trial interruptions and prevent delays.</strong>
   Ms. Awashish was charged with  impaired driving and driving “over 80.” When a person is charged with a crime,  s/he has a right to see copies of the documents related to the charges. This is  called disclosure. The Crown (the prosecution) gave Ms. Awashish disclosure.  Her lawyer asked for more documents. These related to the breathalyzer used to  test her, including maintenance records and training records for the person  using it. A provincial court judge ordered the Crown to give Ms. Awashish the  documents. In a criminal case, there will  normally be a final decision, called a judgment, which results in a verdict of  guilty or not guilty. But a judge will also make other smaller decisions along  the way, such as how much court time a trial will take or what evidence should  be admitted. These smaller decisions normally can’t be challenged, except as  part of an appeal of the trial judgment to a higher court (that is, after a  guilty or not-guilty verdict). There are only very limited exceptions to this  rule. In this case, though, the Crown  asked a superior court judge to review the provincial court judge’s decision to  order the disclosure before the trial judgment. It did so using a legal procedure  called <em>certiorari</em>.<em> Certiorari</em> (pronounced different ways,  including ser-tee-oh-RARR-ee) is a court’s power to cancel another court’s  decision because of an obvious mistake. It is not the same as an appeal, and is  rarely granted in criminal cases in Canada. <em>Certiorari </em>was only  even a possibility because Ms. Awashish’s case was being heard before the Court  of Quebec, which is a provincial court, not the Superior Court. Provincial and  territorial courts are sometimes called “inferior courts” because they get  their powers from legislatures. They can’t hear all the same kinds of cases  that superior courts can, and can have their decisions changed by superior  courts. Superior courts, on the other hand, get their powers from the  Constitution. Their decisions can’t be changed by other courts, except when  there is an appeal. Superior courts include most trial courts, and all  provincial and territorial appeal courts. Trial-level superior courts can be  called different names in different provinces; for example, B.C. has a “Supreme  Court” and Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick have “Courts of  Queen’s Bench.”  The Superior Court judge ruled for  the Crown and granted <em>certiorari</em> (that is, canceled the provincial court judge’s order). She agreed with the  Crown that Ms. Awashish didn’t show why the request for additional documents  should be allowed. In response, Ms. Awashish asked the Crown to tell her if it  had the documents she wanted. But the Crown wouldn’t confirm or deny if the  records existed, because it said that they weren’t relevant to her case. The  provincial court judge (the same one who made the original order) once again  ordered the Crown to provide the information. The Crown again asked the  Superior Court for review. A different judge granted a second <em>certiorari</em> application, saying the  information didn’t have to be shared unless Ms. Awashish could show it was  relevant. The Court of Appeal ruled for Ms.  Awashish. It said that <em>certiorari </em>is  only available in limited situations, such as if a party’s basic rights would  be permanently harmed. It said <em>certiorari</em> shouldn’t have been granted because the provincial court judge had the power to  make the decision (even if she made the wrong one). The Supreme Court unanimously ruled  for Ms. Awashish. It said parties could only use <em>certiorari</em> in criminal cases when a provincial or territorial court  judge went beyond his or her powers (a “jurisdictional error”). It agreed with  the Court of Appeal that the provincial court judge applied the wrong rules to  Ms. Awashish’s request. But this was a legal error, which could be corrected on  appeal, not a jurisdictional error that needed to be fixed with <em>certiorari</em>. So, even though the decision  was wrong, <em>certiorari </em>couldn’t be  used to fix it. The Court also noted that letting parties appeal decisions  before trials are finished would create delays. That’s why these types of  appeals, known as “interlocutory appeals,” are not allowed in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. While <em>certiorari</em> is different from an appeal,  courts limit it for the same reason, because lawyers could use it to get around  the rule against interlocutory appeals. The Court noted that it had previously  been clear that courts need to do a better job of finishing criminal trials in  a reasonable time. Allowing <em>certiorari</em> in situations like Ms. Awashish’s would go against that. The decision confirmed the general rule that trials should not be  interrupted to deal with side issues. The Court noted that <em>certiorari </em>would still be available in some circumstances, such as  when a legal error affected other people who wouldn’t have the right to appeal  a judgment. The Court said that if Ms. Awashish asked for disclosure again, the  documents’ relevance should be looked at in light of the Court’s decision in <a href=""37395-37403-eng.aspx""><em>R.  v. Gubbins</em></a>, which was  released on the same day."
2018 SCC 44,"<strong>Breathalyzer maintenance records don’t have to be disclosed unless an  accused person can show they are likely relevant to his or her defence, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
     Mr.  Gubbins and Mr. Vallentgoed were charged with having blood alcohol “over 80” in  separate incidents. As part of their defences, they asked for copies of the  maintenance records for the breathalyzer devices used to test their blood  alcohol levels.  Mr.  Vallentgoed received some records showing that the breathalyzer used to test  him had been sent for repair the day after he was charged, and twice more in  the previous four months. His lawyer asked for more information about the  repair work. The Crown (the prosecution) refused. It said the repair records  belonged to third parties, and that they weren’t relevant anyway. The summary  conviction judge agreed with the Crown, and convicted Mr. Vallentgoed of  driving with blood alcohol “over 80.” The summary conviction appeal judge ruled  for Mr. Vallentgoed, saying the case should go back to trial after the Crown gave  him the records. Mr.  Gubbins also asked for maintenance records for the breathalyzer used to test  him. The Crown said the records were held by a third party (the contractor who  maintained the device). An expert witness testified that maintenance records  weren’t relevant to whether a <em>particular</em> test was accurate, so they weren’t relevant to Mr. Gubbins’ defence. The trial  judge ruled for Mr. Gubbins and ordered the trial stopped until the Crown gave  Mr. Gubbins the records. The summary conviction appeal judge agreed. Mr.  Vallentgoed’s and Mr. Gubbins’ appeals were heard together before the Court of  Appeal because they dealt with the same issue: what records an accused person  has a right to when defending a criminal charge. The Court of Appeal agreed  with the Crown. It restored Mr. Vallentgoed’s conviction and sent Mr. Gubbins’  case back for trial. It said the breathalyzer maintenance records were  “third-party” records and didn’t have to be disclosed. This  case turned on the difference between “first-party” and “third-party” records  in a criminal case. When a person is charged with a crime, the Crown has to  share information related to the person’s defence. There are some exceptions,  for example if the information is “privileged” or protected by law. Some police  records will be considered “first-party” records (like anything created or  gathered by police during the investigation). First-party records have to be  disclosed when the accused person asks, unless the Crown can show they are privileged  or obviously not relevant to the case. Other police records will be considered  “third-party” records (like documents related to police administration or  operations). Documents that aren’t part of the investigation and do not belong  to the police, such as medical records belonging to a hospital, are also  considered third-party records. Third-party records will only be disclosed if  the accused person can show they are likely relevant to the case. The problem  in these cases was that some courts had said breathalyzer maintenance records were  first-party records, while others had said they were third-party records. The  law was not clear. The  majority at the Supreme Court said breathalyzer maintenance records were  third-party records. They didn’t need to be disclosed unless the accused person  could show they were likely relevant to his or her defence. The majority looked  at the relevance of the maintenance records and who controlled them. While they  would be relevant to whether a breathalyzer device was <em>maintained</em> properly, they wouldn’t be relevant to whether it was <em>working</em> on a given day. (Breathalyzers  do self-tests each time they are used; those records were relevant and had  already been shared.) The records weren’t held by the Crown because they belonged  to the RCMP and other third parties, such as contractors. They were not part of  any RCMP investigation file since they were just general operational records. The  majority upheld Mr. Vallentgoed’s conviction and sent Mr. Gubbins’ case for a  new trial. In  this case, the Supreme Court decided how much information about breathalyzer  maintenance records prosecutors have to share with someone accused of an “over  80” offence. This settled a disagreement among lower courts about how these  records should be treated. <a href=""37207-eng.aspx""><em>R. v. Awashish</em></a>, released on the  same day, also dealt with breathalyzer records and an “over 80” driving offence.  It was originally appealed for different reasons."
2018 SCC 43,"<strong>A business that holds keys to a customer’s car parked on its lot doesn’t  necessarily have care and control of that vehicle, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
     The  Econolodge Aeroport hotel, located near Montreal’s Pierre Elliott Trudeau  airport, offered a “park and fly” service where guests could park their cars  for free while they traveled. In winter, guests had to leave their keys with  the hotel to make it easier to remove snow from the parking lot. Econolodge  didn’t have any guards, fences, or cameras in the parking lot, and anyone could  enter at any time.  In  the winters of 2005 and 2006, two cars were stolen from its property. Econolodge  still had the car keys its guests had left behind, and didn’t know about the  thefts until the guests returned. The owners filed claims with their insurance  companies and were compensated under their policies. The insurance companies,  in turn, sued the hotel for not taking reasonable steps to prevent the thefts.  Econolodge said it did nothing wrong, but that even if it had, its own  insurance company should pay. That company, Lombard, covered Econolodge for  civil liability (responsibility for actions that harm others or their property,  but aren’t criminal). Lombard said it didn’t have to pay because there was an  exception in the policy. The exception said it wasn’t responsible when the  hotel had care and control of the vehicles. The  trial judge said Econolodge had a contract with its guests for the “park and  fly” service. Under the Quebec Civil Code, that meant it had to act diligently  in all matters related to the contract. (The Civil Code is the body of law that  applies to non-criminal legal issues in Quebec.) The hotel did not take  reasonable steps to secure the parking area, but let guests believe that it  had. The trial judge said it was therefore responsible. She also said that  Econolodge did not have care and control of the vehicles just because it had  the keys. That meant the exception in the insurance policy did not apply, so Lombard  had to pay. The Court of Appeal agreed that Econolodge was responsible, but disagreed  about the exception. It said Lombard didn’t have to pay because having the car  keys meant Econolodge had control of the vehicles. The  Supreme Court agreed with both lower courts that Econolodge was responsible for  the thefts. But it said that the trial judge wasn’t wrong to decide the policy  exception didn’t apply (which meant Lombard had to pay). She also wasn’t wrong  to say that Econolodge didn’t have care and control of the vehicles in the  legal sense. Looking at the full situation, the Court said it was open to the  trial judge to conclude that people only left their keys with the hotel for a  limited reason. This was to make it easier to clear snow from the lot; summer  guests didn’t have to leave their keys at all. Econolodge wasn’t really taking  “control” of the vehicles, then. Lombard’s insurance policy was meant to cover exactly  this kind of situation—when the insured is at fault providing its usual  services, and harms others (or their property) in the process. One of the  reasons for the exception was to avoid the policy being used as a backdoor way  to insure third-party property that had nothing to do with the contractual services. This case dealt with  the application of part of a standard commercial insurance contract.  Econolodge’s fault fell within what the insurance policy was supposed to cover,  so the insurance company had to pay for it."
2018 SCC 40,"<strong>The Crown has to act honourably toward Canada’s Indigenous peoples, but  this does not mean Parliament has to consult them when making laws, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>
   The  Mikisew Cree First Nation is a band whose traditional territory is mostly in  northeastern Alberta, and contains oil sands. The Mikisew joined Treaty 8 along  with other groups in 1899. Treaty 8 was the eighth agreement signed by Queen  Victoria and First Nations in Western Canada. Under the treaty, in exchange for  giving up their ownership of a large amount of land, the Mikisew kept the right  to hunt, trap, and fish on it. Today, aboriginal treaty rights, like those  under Treaty 8, are protected by the Constitution. Treaties  are understood to be between Indigenous groups and “the Crown.” “The Crown”  means Canada as a state. The Crown negotiated and signed treaties like the one  with the Mikisew in 1899, and still has a duty to fulfill them today. The Crown  also has other duties, based on the Aboriginal and constitutional law concept  of the “honour of the Crown.” This requires the Crown to act honourably toward  Indigenous peoples. In  2012, the federal government introduced two bills that changed how Canada’s  environment would be protected. The Mikisew said their rights to hunt, trap,  and fish on the land would be harmed by the new laws. Oil companies and others  would be allowed to build structures on or near many waterways without  government approval. The Mikisew said no one would be making sure fish and  wildlife wouldn’t be harmed. They were not consulted on the changes. The  Mikisew said that the government had a legal duty to consult them, rooted in  the honour of the Crown. In 2013, the Mikisew asked the Federal Court to review  the bills, formally declare that the government should have consulted them, and  block the new laws. At  the Federal Court, the application judge said the Crown should have consulted  the Mikisew when developing the bills. But the Federal Court of Appeal disagreed,  saying the Federal Court didn’t have jurisdiction (power) to hear the Mikisew’s  application in the first place. It also said courts should only be able to hear  challenges to laws that have been passed, not laws that are being developed and  debated. This was because Parliament, not the Crown, develops and passes law,  according to the “separation of powers” in the Canadian Constitution.  Separation  of powers means that different branches of the state have different roles in  Canada’s democracy. The executive (which includes the Prime Minister and  Cabinet) decides policy and implements laws (for example, by passing  regulations). The legislature (Parliament) makes and passes laws. The judiciary  (the courts) interprets and applies laws once they are passed. In this case,  the Mikisew said the Ministers were acting in their executive roles when they  introduced the laws. The government said they were acting in their legislative  roles. At  the Supreme Court of Canada, all the judges agreed that the Federal Court did  not have jurisdiction to review the actions of the federal Ministers who developed<strong> </strong>the bills. This was because the <em>Federal Courts Act</em> said it could only  review decisions of a federal board, commission, or other tribunal. Ministers  working on policies that might eventually become law did not fall into any of  these categories. The judges disagreed about the honour of the Crown and the  duty to consult. Justice Andromache Karakatsanis said  that there was no duty to consult during the law-making process. However, she  said that while Parliament didn’t have to consult the Mikisew, that didn’t mean  the Crown was off the hook. The honour of the Crown applied to both the  executive and Parliament, even if the duty to consult only applied to executive  action. The Crown still had to act honourably toward the Mikisew when a law  might negatively affect their treaty rights. Justice Karakatsanis noted that it  didn’t matter to the Mikisew and other groups whether action that harmed their  rights was taken by the executive or by Parliament. However, she said the duty  to consult wasn’t the only possible way for them to protect their  constitutional rights, and other approaches could be developed. Two judges  agreed with Justice Karakatsanis. Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella agreed with Justice Karakatsanis that  Parliament had a duty to uphold the honour of the Crown. But she went further  and said that this included a duty to consult Indigenous groups when making  laws that might adversely affect them. What mattered was the effect of  government action on Aboriginal rights, not which branch of government the  action came from. She said that parliamentary sovereignty and privilege could  not override the honour of the Crown, which was also protected by the  Constitution. One judge agreed with Justice Abella. Justice  Russell Brown said the honour of the Crown only bound the executive, not  Parliament. That meant Parliament didn’t have a duty to consult the Mikisew.  Even though Ministers are part of the executive (as members of Cabinet), they  act in their legislative roles when they introduce and debate bills. For Justice  Brown, getting courts involved during the lawmaking process (through the duty  to consult or another approach) would violate the separation of powers and  parliamentary privilege. He said this would create a lot of uncertainty. For  him, bills could only be challenged in court once they became law, but not  before. Justice Malcolm Rowe agreed with everything Justice Brown said, but  added three additional reasons he thought there should be no duty to consult  when preparing laws. He said there were other ways for the Mikisew to assert  their rights without interfering with Parliament’s independence. He also said  it could make it very complicated for governments to prepare legislation and  budgets. Finally, he said that it would put courts in the position of  supervising dealings between Indigenous groups and legislators, something they  are not well suited to do. Two other judges agreed with Justice Rowe (and with  Justice Brown). This case  was about whether the Crown had a duty to consult Aboriginal peoples when  deciding on changes to laws that may harm their treaty rights, and whether courts  had a role in enforcing it. A total of five judges said the honour of the Crown  was involved at the lawmaking stage. But a total of seven said there was no  binding duty to consult before a law was passed."
2018 SCC 39,"<strong>The Speaker of the Quebec  legislature couldn’t use parliamentary privilege to avoid the grievance process  when he fired three security guards, the Supreme Court has ruled. Parliamentary  privilege only covers decisions that are necessary for a legislature to fulfill  its constitutional role. </strong>
     In 2012, the Speaker of Quebec’s  National Assembly (its legislature) fired three security guards for using  Assembly cameras to watch people in nearby hotel rooms. The security guards didn’t  think they should be fired. Their union filed grievances (a formal complaint  under a collective agreement) on their behalf. This was the normal procedure  for civil servants who felt they had been wrongly fired by their employer. In this case, however, the Speaker said  his decision to fire the security guards was covered by “parliamentary  privilege.” Parliamentary privilege is a kind of immunity (legal protection)  that comes from the Constitution. It is meant to allow legislatures to operate without  outside interference. It applies both to individual elected members and to the  legislature as a whole. The Speaker said no one else was allowed to review his  decision—not even a labour arbitrator—because it was covered by privilege. (A labour  arbitrator is a person who decides complaints under a collective agreement.) The Speaker based his argument on  two specific types of privilege. The first was the privilege over the  management of employees. The second was the privilege to exclude “strangers” from  the National Assembly building, a task the security guards did on the Speaker’s  behalf. (“Strangers” are people who aren’t members or officials of the  legislature.) While both sides agreed that the privilege existed, they  disagreed on whether it covered the firing of the guards.  The arbitrator ruled for the security  guards, saying that the decision to fire them was not protected by  parliamentary privilege, and that the grievances could be heard. The Speaker  asked the courts to review the arbitrator’s decision. The reviewing judge ruled  for the Speaker, saying the decision was, in fact, covered by privilege, and the  arbitrator wasn’t allowed to hear the dispute. The Court of Appeal disagreed  and ruled against the Speaker, saying parliamentary privilege did not apply. Justice  Andromache Karakatsanis also ruled against the Speaker, saying that  parliamentary privilege did not apply to his decision to fire the security  guards. She said the purpose of parliamentary privilege was to allow the  Assembly and its members to do the work they needed to do under the  Constitution independently and with dignity and efficiency. The scope of  protected decisions had to be limited to what was closely and directly  connected to the legislature’s constitutional role. This was important because  courts can’t review decisions protected by privilege—even ones that go against  the <em>Charter</em>. Justice Karakatsanis  said that, while security was crucial to the legislature’s work, not all decisions  about security guard management had to be protected. She also said that, while  excluding strangers from the legislative buildings was protected by privilege,  protecting a decision to fire employees who helped do that was going too far. While  the Speaker could fire the security guards if he had a good reason, Justice  Karakatsanis said he still had to follow the same process for them as he would  for any other civil servant. She said the dispute should go back to the  arbitrator to decide. Five judges agreed with Justice Karakatsanis. Justice Malcolm  Rowe agreed that the case should be sent back to the arbitrator to decide, but  for different reasons. He said the Assembly had set out how it would deal with  employee management in the <em>Act Respecting  the National Assembly</em>. In his view, the Assembly defined how it would use  its privilege by passing this law. Under the Act, all employees of the National  Assembly were civil servants, with the same rights and obligations as other  members of the civil service. The Act provided a procedure to remove employees  from the public service employment scheme, but the procedure was not exercised  in this case. Justice Rowe said that the legislature couldn’t set out the rules  that would apply to it in law, and then later rely on privilege to depart from that  law.  Justices  Suzanne Côté and Russell Brown, writing in dissent, would have ruled for the  Speaker. They said security was critical to the Assembly’s ability to do its  work, and the Speaker delegated certain security tasks, including the exclusion  of strangers, to the guards. This meant there was a close and direct link  between their work and the work of the Assembly, and so they were covered by parliamentary  privilege. So was the Speaker’s management of these employees, and his decision  to fire them. Justices Côté and Brown noted that giving an arbitrator the power  to revise the Speaker’s decision to fire guards he no longer had confidence in  would take away the Assembly’s control over part of its security.  This decision made clear the scope  of the parliamentary privilege over two activities: the management of employees  and the exclusion of strangers. The majority and dissenting judges agreed that privilege  should be limited to what was necessary for a legislature to fulfil its role.  But the majority judges did not think the Speaker’s decision in this particular  case qualified."
2018 SCC 38,"<strong>Internet service providers  (ISPs) can charge copyright holders for some steps taken to identify customers  suspected of illegal downloading, the Supreme Court has ruled. But they can’t  charge for things that they already have to do for free under the <em>Copyright Act.</em></strong>
   Online copyright infringement  (illegal downloading of movies and music) has become common in Canada. Until  2015, no legislation specifically dealt with the problem. But a copyright owner  could find out the identity of a downloader by getting a court order for the  ISP to reveal it. To compensate ISPs for their time and effort, and to prevent  them from being overwhelmed with requests, ISPs could charge a reasonable  amount of money for the service. All of this fell under common law rules (rules  created over time by courts). After consulting with both  copyright owners and consumers, the federal government updated the <em>Copyright Act</em>. The Act’s “notice-and-notice  regime” came into force in 2015. It was meant to work together with the  existing common law rules. Both common law (made by courts) and statutory law  (made by Parliament) are equally valid. But Parliament can change the common  law by passing a statute (like the Act), if it wants to. Where statutory law  (like the Act) doesn’t cover something, the common law can fill in the blanks.  One of the goals of the notice-and-notice  regime is to discourage infringement. It does this by letting customers know when  their accounts have been used to illegally download copyrighted content. Under  the regime, a copyright owner first has to tell an ISP that it thinks one of  the ISP’s customers has shared content illegally. Normally, the copyright owner  doesn’t know the customer’s real identity. It only knows the Internet Protocol  (IP) address used to download the files. Only the ISP can connect the IP  address to a specific customer. The ISP must figure out who was using the IP  address at the time of the infringement. It must then pass on a notice to the  customer, usually by an automatic message to the email address linked to the  account. It then confirms (provides notice) to the copyright owner that this  has been done. Under the Act, the ISP can’t charge the copyright owner for  doing this. If a copyright owner wants to know  a customer’s identity after notice has been given, it still has to get a court  order. The Act says the ISP has to keep records so it can link IP addresses to  customers later. It also says the ISP can’t charge a fee for keeping these  records. A group of film producers got  together to fight illegal sharing of their films. They wanted to know the  real-life identity of a Rogers customer so that they could sue that person. They  had the customer’s IP address, and got a court order for Rogers to give them the  person’s contact and personal information. The producers eventually planned to  sue about 55,000 more customers, so this would be the first of many requests. Rogers  collected the information, but said the producers had to pay a fee for it. It  argued that the notice-and-notice regime didn’t say that ISPs had to share  customers’ real-life identities with copyright owners. That meant the old  common law rules still applied when copyright owners asked for this information.  The producers disagreed. They said disclosing customer identities was part of  the regime created by the <em>Copyright Act</em>,  and so Rogers couldn’t charge anything for the information. The Federal Court ruled for Rogers,  and said ISPs could be compensated for all steps taken to identify a customer  to a copyright owner. But the Federal Court of Appeal disagreed. It said the  Act said Rogers had to keep the information that would identify customers  anyway. It said Rogers couldn’t be compensated for steps it took that  overlapped with things it already had to do under the Act. Justice Russell Brown, writing for  the majority, said ISPs should be paid a reasonable amount to comply with court  orders to reveal customer identities. But they shouldn’t be paid to do things  they already had to do under the notice-and-notice regime. Justice Brown said  the regimerequired the ISP to give  notice to the customer and inform the copyright owner that it did so. He said  this included a duty to make sure the information was accurate. That meant  Rogers could not charge a copyright owner to check the information to make sure  it was correct. He noted that Rogers followed an eight-step process to respond  to court orders asking for customer identities. Some of the steps had to be  done anyway to comply with the Act, and so he said Rogers should not be paid  for them. But others, like connecting the IP address to the person’s real-life  identity and sharing that with the copyright owner, were not covered by the  Act. Rogers could therefore charge a fee for them. Seven other judges agreed  with Justice Brown. Justice Suzanne Côté  agreed that ISPs should be paid a reasonable amount to disclose customer  identities as part of a court order. But she said Rogers should be able to  charge for all eight steps in this case. In her view, the steps were not about  confirming that the records were accurate. They were about confirming the  customer’s real-life identity <em>using </em>those  records. Justice Côté said that even if some steps were to confirm that the  records were accurate, Rogers should still be compensated. This was because  people’s contact information could have changed, or some notices may have been  sent to the wrong people. Making a mistake in identifying a customer could mean  that the copyright owner might sue the wrong person. For that reason, Justice  Côté said that Rogers should be able to charge a reasonable amount for  following a careful process. She said Rogers and other ISPs could only charge  for steps that were necessary, though. This case was about the  interpretation of part of the <em>Copyright  Act</em> that dealt with who should have to pay for an ISP to reveal a  customer’s identity. The appeal was based on a pre-trial motion and the courts  have not decided whether copyright infringement actually took place. Both Justice Brown and Justice Côté agreed  that the matter should go back to the motion judge to decide how much Rogers  should be paid."
2018 SCC 37,"<strong>Police officers can’t reveal information about confidential informers to  anyone, including lawyers defending them for crimes, the Supreme Court has  confirmed. The same rule applies to police as to everyone else: information can  only be revealed if there is a risk that an innocent person will go to jail.</strong>
  In  2011, four British Columbia RCMP officers were charged with breach of trust,  fraud, and obstruction of justice relating to their conduct with a  protected witness who was under their care in the “Surrey Six” gang murder case. When  the officers were charged with the crimes, they were told they couldn’t tell  anyone anything that might expose confidential informers. This included their  lawyers. The officers said they wanted to talk about confidential informers  with their lawyers to see if it would help defend themselves against the  charges. The Crown pointed out that no confidential informers were involved in  the acts the officers were charged with (the protected witness was not one). It  said the information wasn’t relevant to the  officers’ defence, and they shouldn’t be allowed to share it. This  case involved a legal concept known as “privilege.” Privilege protects certain  kinds of information from being revealed. “Solicitor-client privilege” is a well-known  type, and protects communications between a client and a lawyer. But there are  other kinds. This case dealt with “informer privilege,” which protects the  identities of confidential informers who help police. Because it is in the  public interest to encourage people to come forward to help police solve crimes,  and because informers may be harmed if their identities are revealed, the  protection is strong. Courts have said there is only one exception, known as  “innocence at stake.” This is when there is a real risk that an innocent person  may go to jail, and s/he can’t raise reasonable doubt about his or her guilt  any other way. The trial judge ruled for the officers. Appeals to the Court of Appeal on  technical issues did not change the result.  Justice  Rosalie Silberman Abella, writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, ruled for the  Crown. She stressed the importance of informer privilege, noting the real danger  to people and the justice system itself if sensitive information were revealed.  She said police officers have special obligations because of the positions of  trust that they hold. That includes protecting the identities of confidential  informers. The only reason the accused in this case had information about  confidential informers at all was because of their work as police officers.  Other accused persons would never have the benefit of such information, so  preventing the officers from sharing it did not disadvantage them. Police  officers are entitled to the full protection of the law, and to be treated  fairly, but they are not entitled to be treated better than other accused. Justice  Abella said that, like other accused, police officers should not be allowed to share  informer-privileged information with their lawyers unless they show they might  be wrongfully convicted if they don’t. The officers in this case never argued  that they would be; they only said the information might be relevant to their  defence.  This  decision confirmed that the only time an exception will be made to informer  privilege is when there is a danger someone will be wrongfully convicted of a  crime. It made clear that solicitor-client privilege doesn’t destroy informer  privilege, and doesn’t<strong> </strong>allow police  officers to identify confidential informers to their lawyers. <strong>NOTE: </strong>This Case in Brief  was not published at the time of the decision due to a publication ban. It was  published on May 8, 2019, after the publication ban was lifted."
2018 SCC 36,"<strong><abbr title=""British Columbia"">BC</abbr> does not have to give a  tobacco company databases of health care information about individual BC  residents as part of a lawsuit, the Supreme Court has said.</strong>
   In 2000,  the province of British Columbia passed the <em>Tobacco  Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act</em>. This let it sue tobacco  companies for health-care costs related to tobacco use, and the Supreme Court  found it constitutional in 2005. In 2001, BC sued Philip Morris International  and other tobacco companies. Philip Morris makes and sells Marlboro cigarettes,  among other brands.  <abbr title=""British Columbia"">BC</abbr> sued  “on an aggregate basis,” meaning on behalf of a group of insured persons,  rather than for any individual. To prove that tobacco caused health care  problems and how much those problems cost, it said it would rely on several  databases. The databases held individual health-care information for BC  residents between 1991 and 2011, such as costs of medical care, prescription  drug use, and status of health coverage.  Anyone  being sued has a right to see the evidence the other party is relying on. This allows  a defendant to challenge the evidence, and is part of a fair trial. Philip  Morris asked for the databases. However, the Act said that if <abbr title=""British Columbia"">BC</abbr> sued on behalf  of a population (“on an aggregate basis”), it could not share information about  individuals insured by its health plan. As a compromise, BC said that the  tobacco companies could look at individual-level information at a Statistics  Canada Research Data Centre, under strict controls. While other tobacco companies  agreed, Philip Morris did not think this was enough to make the trial fair. It  asked the court to order BC to give it the databases directly, with names and  other identifying information removed. It also asked for individuals to be  linked across databases, to make it easier to analyze the data. The trial  judge ordered <abbr title=""British Columbia"">BC</abbr> to share the databases, after removing identifying  information. He said that the databases were not the kind of health care  records the Act was meant to cover. The Court of Appeal agreed. It said that BC  should not be able to rely on evidence while denying Philip Morris access to  it. It also said there was no real threat to personal privacy. Justice  Russell Brown, writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, disagreed with the lower courts  and ruled for BC. He said the databases did contain information about  individuals, so could not be shared. Compiling individual health-care information  into databases did not change the <em>kind</em> of information it was. Besides, the Act said even documents <em>relating</em> <em>to </em>individual health care benefits could not be shared. The lower  courts did not consider this. Justice Brown said the lower courts were wrong to  focus on how relevant the databases were to the lawsuit, rather than on the  kind of information the Act said could not be shared. He also pointed out that  information about “particular” insured persons did not mean information about “identifiable”  insured persons under the Act. That meant that removing identifying information  would not solve the problem. Justice Brown said that it was too early in  the process to talk about trial fairness, because the Act protected it in other  ways. Also, the Supreme Court had already found the Act constitutional, meaning  it considered it would not lead to unfair trials. He noted that BC would have  to share the databases with Philip Morris if an expert witness relied on them  in court. Philip Morris could also ask for a “statistically meaningful sample,”  with identifying information removed, under a different part of the Act.  In a  similar case in 2016, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal said that New Brunswick  did not have to share similar databases with tobacco companies. (The Act passed  by New Brunswick is mostly the same as <abbr title=""British Columbia"">BC</abbr>’s.) This decision ensures a similar  provision is applied the same way in both provinces."
2018 SCC 35,"<strong>A property owner who thinks  s/he is the victim of “disguised expropriation” needs to act in a reasonable  time to challenge a municipal by-law, the Supreme Court has ruled. An owner can  still ask to be compensated for the loss in property value even if the court rejects  the challenge.</strong>
   In 1989, the numbered company  2646-8926 Québec inc. bought a wooded property in the town of Lorraine. Mr.  Pichette, the majority shareholder, planned to build a housing subdivision  there eventually. But in 1991 the town passed a zoning regulation and included  over half of the property in a conservation area. Mr. Pichette did not find out  about this until about ten years later when he visited the land for the first  time. He tried to get the town to change its mind about what it had done to the  property, but it didn’t. Mr. Pichette accused the town of “disguised  expropriation.” Disguised expropriation is when a government illegally takes away some of the rights of owning  a property (but not the property itself) without fair compensation. In this  case, Mr. Pichette said passing a zoning by-law that unfairly limited use of  the property without fair compensation was disguised expropriation.<strong></strong>
   A  property owner who thinks the government has taken away his or her property illegally  can ask the courts for help. For example, a court can cancel a by-law or  declare that it can’t be applied to the property. The court’s power in these cases is  discretionary, meaning it can refuse to intervene, for example, if the property  owner waited too long to do anything. Mr. Pichette’s company turned to the  courts for help in 2007. The company asked for the by-law to be overturned and  for the town to pay damages.  The trial judge said the two issues  (overturning the by-law and the damages) should be decided separately. He focused  on the by-law, keeping the issue of damages aside to decide later. He rejected  the request to overturn the by-law because it was made too late. The  Court of Appeal disagreed with this. It said the trial judge should have thought about whether the by-law was  an abuse of power, which courts could intervene to correct even though there  was a delay. (An abuse of power is when a state actor does something that it  was not supposed to, with or without bad intent.)<strong> </strong>The Court of Appeal ruled for the property owner, but sent the matter  back to the lower court to decide on compensation. The town appealed. Chief Justice Richard Wagner,  writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, ruled for the town. The question before  the Court was whether the trial judge could refuse to declare the by-law unenforceable  against the owner of the land. Specifically, it was whether the trial judge  could refuse to do so when the owner claimed the by-law was illegal, but waited  too long to take legal action. Chief Justice Wagner said the trial judge’s  decision to deny the claim because of the delay was reasonable. The trial judge  was allowed to use his discretion this way in this situation. Sixteen years had  passed from the time the by-law came into effect to the time the company  challenged it in court. At least four years had passed from the time Mr.  Pichette learned about it. Both delays were unreasonable. Also, the Civil Code  of Quebec said the owner no longer had a right to make the claim because it had  waited more than ten years to act. However, Chief Justice Wagner noted that an  owner who didn’t challenge a by-law in a reasonable time could still ask for compensation  to cover the loss in property value caused by the by-law. He didn’t decide on  compensation in this case, because that issue was separate from the issue of  whether the by-law could be enforced, as the trial judge had said.<strong></strong>
     This case dealt with zoning  regulations that a property owner said amounted to disguised expropriation. The  decision confirmed that an owner trying to have a zoning  by-law declared void or unenforceable has to act in a reasonable time to defend  the rights claimed, or the request will be denied."
2018 SCC 34,"<strong>Refusing a breathalyzer after causing a fatal accident is as serious as the  crime of drunk driving causing death, the Supreme Court has confirmed. </strong>
     In  May 2013, two year-old Geo Mounsef was killed when Richard Alan Suter drove his  car onto a restaurant patio where the Mounsef family was eating dinner. Mr.  Suter and his wife were arguing as he pulled up to park in front of the  restaurant. At one point, he accidentally hit the gas pedal instead of the  brake and drove into the patio. The sentencing judge later found that Mr. Suter  wasn’t impaired by alcohol at the time. Mr.  Suter was arrested. He spoke to a legal aid lawyer, who confused him and gave  him bad legal advice by telling him not to provide a breath sample. Mr. Suter  then refused to provide the sample, despite being told by a police officer that  this was a crime.  Sometime  after his arrest, Mr. Suter was abducted by a group of vigilantes who used a  set of pruning shears to cut off his thumb. The attack was linked to the death  of Geo Mounsef. Mr.  Suter pleaded guilty to refusing to provide a breath sample after causing an  accident where someone died. There is a wide range of possible penalties for  this, depending on the circumstances and the offender’s moral blame. The  maximum penalty is life in prison, the same as for drunk driving causing death.  This is to reflect the seriousness of the crime and discourage people from  refusing. When a person refuses to provide a breath sample, it means the  police, court, public, and family of the person who died will never really know  whether the driver was impaired or “over 80” at the time. The  sentencing judge would have sent Mr. Suter to prison for over three years, but lowered  the sentence to four months plus a thirty-month driving ban because of the  circumstances. He said four months was appropriate because Mr. Suter’s refusal  to provide a breath sample was based on the lawyer’s bad advice, and that  “fundamentally” reduced his moral blame. Both Mr. Suter and the Crown appealed.  The Court of Appeal increased his prison sentence to twenty-six months.  Justice  Michael Moldaver, writing for the majority at the Supreme Court, said that both  the Court of Appeal and sentencing judge made errors. The Court of Appeal, in  raising Mr. Suter’s sentence to twenty-six months, effectively punished Mr.  Suter for crimes he wasn’t charged with (careless driving or dangerous driving  causing death). It also didn’t consider the vigilante attack as part of his  total circumstances. On the other hand, the sentencing judge, in sentencing Mr.  Suter to four months, gave too much weight to the fact that Mr. Suter was not  drunk at the time and received bad legal advice. Justice Moldaver agreed with the  sentencing judge that Mr. Suter should have received a lower sentence than  would normally be the case. But given the sentencing judge’s errors and the seriousness  of the crime, he thought four months was too low. He decided that a 15- to  18-month sentence would have been appropriate at the time of the plea. However,  Mr. Suter had already served just over 10½ months in custody, and spent almost  nine months awaiting the Supreme Court’s decision. Justice Moldaver said that  sending him back to jail now would serve no useful purpose, so he reduced the  sentence to “time served” (leaving the thirty-month driving ban in place). Five  judges agreed. Justice  Clément Gascon disagreed and would have kept the four-month sentence. While he  would have weighed the facts differently than the sentencing judge did, he  didn’t find the sentence “clearly unreasonable” (the legal standard required to  change it). Justice Gascon said the circumstances of this case were unique and particularly  sympathetic; Mr. Suter was sober and only refused the breath sample because he  was explicitly told to by his state-provided lawyer. This left him with very  little moral blame. In any case, he said, the sentencing judge was in the best  position to weigh these facts and decide an appropriate sentence. This was the first  time the Court ruled on 2008 changes to the <em>Criminal  Code</em> that raised penalties for refusing a breath sample after an accident where  someone is hurt or dies. The changes meant that refusing a breath sample would  lead to the same penalties as impaired and “over 80” offences causing injury or  death. The decision highlighted that a sentence must match both the seriousness  of the crime and the person’s level of responsibility.

error:https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/cb/37318-37209-eng.aspx,"<strong>The Law Societies of British Columbia and Ontario had the power to deny  approval to a proposed law school that would have required students to follow a  religiously-based code of conduct restricting sexual behaviour, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>
   Trinity  Western University (TWU) is a private Christian university in Langley, British  Columbia. It wants to open a law school. At TWU, all students and faculty have  to follow a code of conduct (known as a “covenant”) that prohibits sexual  intimacy except within marriage between a man and a woman. Students and faculty  must follow the covenant the whole time they attend or work at TWU, whether  they are on or off campus. The Law  Society of British Columbia regulates lawyers in B.C., while the Law Society of  Ontario (formerly known as the Law Society of Upper Canada) does the same in  Ontario. Both Law Societies get their powers from the government. One of their  roles is to protect the public interest in deciding who can practice law in  those provinces. Usually, a person who wants to become a lawyer must have a  degree from an approved law school.  <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr> applied for approval of its proposed law school in both B.C. and Ontario. In  B.C., the Law Society put the decision to a vote by its members (all lawyers  already licensed to practice law there). A majority voted against <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr>'s  proposal, and the Law Society passed a resolution to formalize the decision. In  Ontario, the Law Society’s “benchers” (board of directors) decided not to  approve the proposal.  <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr> and  one of its graduates (who hoped to attend the law school) asked the courts to review  the Law Societies’ decisions in both provinces. They said that the decisions  violated freedom of religion and other rights protected under the <em>Charter</em>. In B.C., the B.C. Supreme Court  and Court of Appeal ruled for <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr> and said that the Law Society’s decision was  invalid. In Ontario, the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal both ruled for  the Law Society. At the  Supreme Court of Canada, the majority ruled for the Law Societies. Justices  Rosalie Silberman Abella, Michael Moldaver, Andromache Karakatsanis, Richard  Wagner (who was not yet Chief Justice when the cases were heard), and Clément  Gascon wrote their reasons together. For them, the question the Court had to  answer was whether the Law Societies’ decisions not to approve <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr>’s proposed law  school were reasonable. They said that they were. To be considered reasonable,  the decisions had to strike a proportionate balance between the religious  rights of the <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr> community and the Law Societies’ objectives to protect the  public interest. For the majority, the “public interest” included promoting  equality by ensuring equal access to the legal profession, supporting diversity  within the bar, and preventing harm to LGBTQ law students. Neither Law Society  was stopping someone from following his or her own religious beliefs (including  following the covenant if s/he wanted to). They only prevented <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr> from  enforcing beliefs on other members of the law school community. Because of this,  the majority said the decisions did not seriously limit anyone’s religious freedoms.  As the benefits of  protecting the public interest were important, and the limitation on religious  rights was minor, the majority said that both decisions reflected a  proportionate balance, and were therefore reasonable. Then-Chief Justice Beverley  McLachlin agreed with the majority that the Law Societies’ decisions were  proportionate and reasonable. However, she disagreed with their approach. In  her view, courts reviewing administrative decisions challenged under the <em>Charter</em> should first look at whether a <em>Charter </em>right  (rather than a value) has been breached. If so, the state actor that made the  decision has to show that the infringement is reasonable and justifiable in a  free and democratic society. Unlike the majority, she considered the limitation  on the religious, expressive, and associational rights of the <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr> community to  be serious. But, in addition to negative effects on diversity and equality  within the legal profession, she emphasized that approving <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr>’s proposal would  condone discrimination against LGBTQ people based on sexual orientation. The  Law Societies’ refusal to condone this discrimination was in keeping with their  legal obligations to act in the public interest. In Chief Justice McLachlin’s  view, these obligations outweighed <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr>’s claims to freedom of religion.  Justice Malcolm Rowe agreed with the  majority that the Law Societies’ decisions were reasonable, but disagreed with  both how and why they reached this conclusion. Like Chief Justice McLachlin and  the dissent, Justice Rowe said that the analysis must focus on <em>Charter </em>rights  (rather than <em>Charter </em>values). Like them, he also said that the state  actor bears the burden of justifying any limit on those rights. In this case,  however, Justice Rowe said the Law Societies’ decisions did not infringe the <em>Charter</em> rights raised by <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr>. The TWU community was not just seeking to protect its own  beliefs and practices. It wanted the Law Societies to approve a law school  where students would be forced to follow Evangelical Christian beliefs –  whether they shared these beliefs or not. Justice Rowe said that freedom of  religion protects the right to believe in whatever one chooses and to follow  those beliefs. But it does not protect the right to impose those beliefs and  practices on others. For this reason, he said that <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr>’s claim fell outside the  scope of freedom of religion protected by the <em>Charter</em>.  Justices Suzanne Côté and Russell  Brown disagreed with the other judges, and would have ruled for <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr>. Writing in  dissent, they said that the laws that gave the Law Societies their powers  limited what they could consider in deciding whether to approve a law school.  For them, the decision was only about whether graduates would be fit to  practice law (i.e., competent and ethical). Since there was no evidence that  the graduates would not be fit, they said the Law Societies should have  approved <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr>’s proposal. In the dissenting justices’ view, freedom of religion  also protects the freedom to express religious views (for example, through the  covenant) and to associate to study law in an educational community reflecting  their religious beliefs. They disagreed with Chief Justice McLachlin that  approving the proposal meant condoning discrimination. For them, a state actor  (like a law society) accommodating a private actor (like a faith-based  university) does not mean it supports the private actor’s beliefs. If this were  so, it would indirectly force private actors to follow the <em>Charter</em> (even  though the <em>Charter</em> only applies to state actors). They noted that it is  also in the public interest to accommodate different religious beliefs. They  also noted that law societies in other provinces had approved <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr>’s proposed  law school. For Justices Côté and Brown, the Law Societies’ decisions seriously  limited the religious freedom of members of the <abbr title=""Trinity Western University"">TWU</abbr> community, and they were  not justified.  While both the B.C. and Ontario cases had separate histories, they dealt  with the same issue and were heard at the Supreme Court on the same days. In the  end, eight judges agreed that the Law Societies’ decisions limited religious  freedoms (the five majority judges, Chief Justice McLachlin, and the two dissenting  judges). However, five (the majority) said the limitation was not serious,  while three (Chief Justice McLachlin and the two dissenting judges) said it was  serious. Six of the eight judges who said there was a limitation said it was reasonable  (the five majority judges and Chief Justice McLachlin). One judge (Justice  Rowe) said no religious freedoms were infringed."
2018 SCC 31,"<strong>The Canadian Human Rights  Tribunal did not have the power to decide if parts of the Indian Act were  discriminatory, because legislation is not a “service” provided to the public,  the Supreme Court has confirmed. Individuals could still make a <em>Charter</em> claim  in court, however.</strong>
     Indigenous persons can be  registered as status “Indians” under the <em>Indian  Act</em>, the law that determines who qualifies as “Indian.” (“Indian” is an  outdated term to refer to an Indigenous person that still exists in some Canadian  laws.) This gives them access to different programs and services from the  government. Status is not based on ethnicity, heritage, or racial background;  whether it is granted depends on if a person’s parents have (or could get)  status. There are two types of status under the Act. The first, known as  “section 6(1) status” allows a person to pass status on to his or her children,  even if the other parent doesn’t have status. The second, “section 6(2)  status,” does not allow status to be passed on unless the other parent has  status.  Some people who consider  themselves Indigenous may not qualify for status. One reason for this situation  was the existence of past discriminatory government policies that caused people  to lose it. People lost their status by becoming “enfranchised,” which meant losing  their rights under the <em>Indian Act</em>. One  policy encouraged people to give up status to get basic rights other Canadians  enjoyed (like full citizenship and the right to own land). Another policy  automatically “enfranchised” any status woman who married a non-status man. The  goal of these policies was to destroy Indigenous culture and assimilate  Indigenous peoples, so they had serious negative effects on Canada’s Indigenous  community. Both policies were ended by 1985, and the government has passed laws  to give status back to people who lost it, as well as to their children and  grandchildren. This case involved two groups of  people who had status they could not pass on to their children or who were not  eligible for status at all. The situation was due to the discriminatory  policies. The groups said that the government had not done enough to undo the  damage done by the previous policies.  The first group was the Matson  siblings, whose grandmother lost her status when she married a non-status man.  While legislation later gave them section 6(2) status, they are not able to  pass status on to children they have with a non-status person. Had their  grandmother never lost her status, they would have had section 6(1) status and  could pass status on to their children no matter what. The second group was the Andrews  family. Mr. Andrews’ father was voluntarily enfranchised before Mr. Andrews was  born. Later legislation was meant to fix the problem, but didn’t quite. It left  Mr. Andrews with section 6(2) status, and his daughter without any status at  all. Had Mr. Andrews’ father never lost status, Mr. Andrews would have been  eligible for section 6(1) status and his daughter for section 6(2) status. The Canadian Human Rights Commission  brought challenges to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal on the Matsons’ and  the Andrewses’ behalf. The Commission argued the law on who qualifies for status  was discriminatory. The Tribunal said it did not have the power to  decide that. The Commission  asked the courts to review the Tribunal’s decisions. Both the Federal Court and  Federal Court of Appeal upheld the decisions.  Justice Clément Gascon, writing  for the Supreme Court majority, said the Tribunal’s decisions to dismiss the  challenges were reasonable. Courts normally give wide latitude to a  decision-maker’s understanding of its own powers under the law that governs it  (its “home statute”), unless a decision falls outside the range of reasonable  outcomes. The <em>Canadian Human Rights Act</em> was the Tribunal’s home statute. The statute said the Tribunal only had the  power to decide if a “service” was being delivered in an unequal way, not  whether the law itself was discriminatory. The Matsons and the Andrewses were arguing the <em>Indian Act</em> itself was discriminatory.  Justice Gascon said it was reasonable for the Tribunal to consider whether a  law could be considered a service, and dismiss the claims when it decided that  it was not. But he made it clear that the Matsons and the Andrewses could still  challenge the <em>Indian Act</em> under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  as the Tribunal had said. Justice Russell Brown agreed  that the Tribunal’s decisions should stand. However, he took issue with part of  the majority’s approach to reviewing administrative decisions in general. Justices  Suzanne Côté and Malcolm Rowe also agreed that the Tribunal’s decisions should  stand, but for different reasons. They said that courts should look at many  factors before deciding whether to give the Tribunal so much latitude. After  considering these factors, they said the Tribunal’s answer to the question  about whether legislation was a “service” didn’t just have to fall within a <em>reasonable  range</em> of answers—it had to be the <em>correct </em>one. That meant courts could overturn a decision  if, for example, the Tribunal had incorrectly said that a complaint challenged  a “service” when it did not. In this case, they found that the Tribunal  was correct when it decided that the act of making laws was not a service, and  they would have upheld the decisions.  The Supreme Court did not rule  on whether parts of the <em>Indian Act</em> were  actually discriminatory, but only confirmed that the Canadian Human Rights  Tribunal did not have the power to decide that. While all the judges agreed on  this point, there was some disagreement about how courts should look at  decisions by administrative bodies.  "
2018 SCC 30,"<strong>Prison authorities must show that psychological and statistical tools  used to make decisions about Indigenous inmates are effective for them, the  Supreme Court has said.</strong>
     Correctional Service of Canada (<abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr>) runs federal prisons. Its goal is to help  rehabilitate inmates, while protecting other inmates, staff, and society as a  whole. To do this, it uses certain psychological and statistical tools to make  decisions about inmates, like whether s/he is likely to reoffend or what kind  of supports s/he should get.  Under the <em>Corrections and  Conditional Release Act</em>, <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> has to “take all reasonable steps to ensure  that any information about an offender that it uses is as accurate, up to date  and complete as possible.” The Act also says <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> must make sure that its policies and programs are suitable  for Indigenous offenders and take their specific needs and circumstances into  account.  Mr. Ewert is a federal inmate and identifies as Métis. He was serving  two simultaneous life sentences for murder and attempted murder. Because certain  tools used to make decisions about him were created based mostly on  non-Indigenous people, Mr. Ewert argued they were less accurate for Indigenous  persons like himself. He said that <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> was not  following the law by using these tools on Indigenous offenders without proof  that they worked.  The Federal Court agreed with Mr. Ewert, but this was overturned by the  Federal Court of Appeal. Mr. Ewert appealed to the Supreme Court. Writing for the majority, Justice Richard Wagner (who was not yet Chief  Justice when the case was heard) granted Mr. Ewert a declaration that <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> was  not obeying the law. He said <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> hadn’t taken  reasonable steps to make sure its tools gave accurate and complete results for  Indigenous offenders. Justice Wagner was concerned about the growing gap between  how Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders are treated in the criminal justice  system. For example, Indigenous offenders are more likely to be classified at a  higher security level and less likely to get early release. He said the gap is  due in part to policies that may look neutral on the surface but actually  discriminate against Indigenous offenders. That’s why it was important to  ensure the tools worked. <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> knew there were concerns about the tools, but it  continued using them anyway. Based on all of this, Justice Wagner formally  declared that <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> violated the law. Six judges agreed with Justice Wagner. Justice Malcolm Rowe,  writing in dissent, disagreed. In his view, “information” clearly meant only  biographical or factual data about an inmate (for example, whether s/he had  been in a fight in prison). It did not mean the results of psychological and  statistical tools. He said that <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> only needed to keep complete and accurate  records of the results of the assessment tools. He agreed with the majority  that it was important to address the high number of Indigenous inmates in  prisons compared to their share of the population. But this had to be done in a  way that respected the logic of the law. Justice Rowe said Mr. Ewert instead should  have asked the courts to review the specific decisions <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> made about him using  the results of the tools. This case dealt with  the interpretation of section 24(1) of the <em>Corrections and Conditional Release Act</em>, in the context of section 4(g) of the same Act. It was the first time  the Court interpreted section 4(g). While the majority formally declared that  <abbr title=""Correctional Service of Canada"">CSC</abbr> had violated the Act, Mr. Ewert would still have to apply for judicial  review to challenge any decision. Mr. Ewert also argued his <em>Charter</em> rights were violated, but those  arguments were rejected.  "
2018 SCC 29,"<strong>Rioters who  damaged police cars after a Montreal hockey game only have to pay for the  specific damage they caused personally, the Supreme Court has ruled. They  cannot be held responsible for damage others caused independently to the same  vehicle.</strong>
     On April 21, 2008, the Montreal Canadiens beat the Boston Bruins in a  playoff hockey game. Street celebrations turned into riots in downtown Montreal.  Nine police cars were destroyed and six more were damaged. Police were able to  identify and arrest about twenty people who did different wrongful acts, from  kicking doors for some to setting cars on fire for others. The City of Montreal  sued the rioters, asking the court to make each one pay for up to the full cost  of the damage to the car he participated in destroying. If one or more of the  other rioters who damaged the same car could not pay, or could not be  identified, others who damaged the same car would have to make up the  difference. The Civil Code of Quebec applies to non-criminal legal issues in the  province. This case dealt with the interpretation of two articles of the Code,  articles 1480 and 1526. Normally, a person who does something wrong will only  have to pay for the exact harm that s/he causes to someone else. But the Code  gives two exceptions, and allows two or more people to each be held responsible  for all the damage in certain situations that don’t involve contracts. Article  1526 says this can happen where two or more people take part in the same  wrongful act or, by separate wrongful acts, contribute to the same damage.  Article 1480 says this can happen if two or more people took part, together, in  the same wrongful act, or separate wrongful acts, and it’s impossible to tell  who actually caused what damage. In either case, a single injury must have been  caused by the people involved for them to each be held liable for up to the  full cost of the damage. The trial judge ordered some rioters who acted together to each pay for  all the damage they caused to a car. For the other rioters, he said that the  two exceptions did not apply. The judge ordered each of these rioters to pay  only for the precise damage they each caused, plus punitive damages. The City  appealed the judgments where the rioters had not all been found responsible for  all the damage. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge. Justice Clément Gascon, writing for the Supreme Court majority, agreed  with the courts below. He said the rioters in this appeal could not each be  held responsible for the total damage caused to a car during the riot. Their  situation did not meet the requirements for either one of the exceptions. The  general principle that a person who does something wrong will only have to pay  for the exact harm that s/he causes to someone else should apply. By their  different wrongful acts, these rioters caused distinct damage. It was possible  to identify the damage each of them caused, since it was caught on camera.  Also, most of these rioters didn’t even know or talk to each other. They acted  on their own, often at different times. They could therefore not have chosen to  act together by either open or unspoken agreement. Five judges agreed with  Justice Gascon. Justice Suzanne Côté had a different opinion. She said the Code did not  require pre-planning or clear agreement for one of the exceptions to apply.  Here, the actions of each person who participated in the destruction of a  particular car were connected because they damaged the same car, in a short  period of time, and egged each other on until that car was seriously damaged or  completely destroyed. These persons acted together to destroy the same car and  should be responsible to pay up to the full amount of the damage caused to that  car. In Justice Côté’s view, both exceptions in the Code apply, even if it were  possible to identify the specific damage one person caused. The seriousness of  each rioter’s wrongful act would help divide responsibility between the members  of the group associated with each car. But each of them remained responsible to  pay up to the full amount to the City. This decision confirmed that damaging property during a riot doesn’t make someone automatically responsible for damage  caused to the same property by other rioters."
2018 SCC 28,"<strong>Current rules to decide where a civil trial should  happen are flexible enough and don’t need to be changed to deal with online  defamation, the Supreme Court has said. It would be fairer and more efficient for Israel to hear the defamation suit  brought against an Israeli newspaper by a Canadian businessperson who owns an  Israeli soccer team. </strong>
     Mitchell Goldhar is a Canadian  businessman who owns a popular Israeli soccer team. He had an apartment in  Israel and visited every few months. In 2011, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz  published an article criticizing his management of the team. The article also mentioned  his Canadian business and management style generally. The article was published  online and available for download in Canada and in Israel. Mr. Goldhar felt the  article was untrue and unfair, and so sued Haaretz for libel (written  defamation, or publishing false information that hurt his reputation). About  200-300 people in Canada and 70,000 people in Israel read the article. This case involved online defamation  in two different countries. When a legal dispute crosses borders, it may not be  clear which courts should hear the case and which laws should apply. Courts decide  these issues by applying “conflict of law” rules. Just because someone sues in a  court in one place, it doesn’t mean that that court is allowed to hear the case  (or meets the first legal test, known as “jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em>”). A court may also decide that, even though it is  allowed to hear the case, it is clearly more appropriate for it to be heard  somewhere else because it would be fairer and more efficient (in legal terms, the  “<em>forum non conveniens</em>” test). Part of deciding  the appropriate place for a case to be heard is deciding which laws should  apply (“choice of law”). <strong> </strong>
     In part, conflict of laws rules are meant  to prevent people from picking and choosing the place where the laws most  benefit them (or most disadvantage their opponents). In this case, Mr. Goldhar sued in  Ontario, but Haaretz said the lawsuit should be heard in Israel. It filed a  motion saying Ontario courts did not have jurisdiction, but even if they did, it  was more appropriate for Israeli courts to hear the case. An Ontario judge ruled  in Mr. Goldhar’s favour on the issue, and the Court of Appeal agreed. Haaretz  appealed to the Supreme Court. Justice Suzanne Côté said that it  was clearly more appropriate for the case to be heard in Israel. Even though  there have been many changes in technology over the years, she said the current  conflict of law rules are still flexible enough to deal with the challenges brought  on by the increase in online publication. Courts have to keep basic principles  of stability and fairness in mind when applying the rules. She said that under  the rules Ontario courts had jurisdiction because the article was read in the  province. (In law, defamation occurs when the untrue statement is “published,” that  is, when it is read or downloaded by even one person.) However, she said that it was clearly more  appropriate for Israeli courts to hear the case. In her view, a trial in Israel  would clearly be more convenient, efficient, and fair. Mr. Goldhar was well known  in Israel and his claim was not limited to his Canadian reputation. Also, since  Haaretz and most of its witnesses were based in Israel, a trial in Ontario would  be unfair and inefficient for them. Two judges agreed with Justice Côté. Justice Andromache Karakatsanis, in  separate reasons, agreed with Justice Côté that Ontario courts should not hear  Mr. Goldhar’s case. She disagreed with Justice Côté on some specific points,  but this did not affect her overall conclusion. Justice  Rosalie Silberman Abella also agreed that  it was more appropriate for Mr. Goldhar’s lawsuit to be heard in Israel. But she  noted that the unique challenges posed by Internet defamation, where all it  takes for defamation to occur is one download, meant it was time to change the  approach. She proposed a new approach to both jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em> and the choice of law under <em>forum non conveniens</em>. This would see courts focus on the place where the person  suing suffered the greatest harm to his or her reputation. It would better  respond to the reality of the Internet, emphasize the importance of reputation,  and strike a better balance between freedom of expression and harm to  reputation concerns.  Justice  Richard Wagner (who was not yet Chief Justice when the appeal was heard) also  agreed that Israeli courts should hear the case. However, he said the <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis should be  tweaked. Like Justice Abella, he said the choice of law in online defamation  cases should be based on where the most harm to reputation occurred, not where  the publication happened. (He did not think the rules about jurisdiction <em>simpliciter </em>needed to change, however.) Using  this new approach, he determined that Israel was clearly a more appropriate place  for the case to be heard than Ontario. Then-Chief  Justice Beverley McLachlin and Justices Michael Moldaver and Clément Gascon,  writing in dissent, said that Ontario courts should hear the case. They agreed  with Justice Côté that the current rules did not need to be changed to deal  with online defamation. However, they thought that Justice Côté was not  applying the rules of <em>forum non conveniens </em>properly in this case. These  rules required that Haaretz meet a high threshold to show that the case should  be heard in Israel. When the dissenting judges applied the rules to the facts,  they found that Israel was not a clearly more appropriate place to hear the  case than Ontario. They noted Mr. Goldhar was most concerned about his Canadian  reputation. They said Ontario law should apply, and Ontario courts should be  the ones to apply it. This case was about how  courts should deal with defamation claims in the Internet era, where material  is “published” in more than one place. Most judges said that the existing rules  were working and would not change them, but came to different conclusions when  they applied the rules. In the end, a majority of judges agreed it would be  clearly more appropriate for Mr. Goldhar’s lawsuit to be heard in Israel. The  Supreme Court did not decide on whether the Haaretz article was actually  defamatory; it only decided that Israeli courts were in the best position to decide  that.

2018 SCC 27,"<strong>A lawyer’s uncivil behaviour in court may not amount to professional  misconduct if it was based on a mistaken understanding of the law, the Supreme  Court has ruled. All the circumstances must be taken into account.</strong> Joseph Groia was the lawyer for John  Felderhof, a Bre-X mining executive charged with insider trading and other  crimes. The trial was tense, marked by personal attacks and sarcastic remarks. During  the first half of the trial, Mr. Groia believed prosecutors were acting wrongly.  He accused them—repeatedly and in harsh language—of abuse of process. Mr. Groia  was actually wrong about the law, but the judge did not correct him. Lawyers have to follow many ethical  rules. In Ontario, these are enforced by the Law Society of Ontario (formerly  known as the Law Society of Upper Canada). The duty to practice law with “civility”  is only one of them. Civility is not just about being polite; when lawyers  attack each other personally, it weakens the justice system. Personal attacks  distract from the parties’ dispute and makes it harder for lawyers to work  together to find solutions. The Law Society can charge lawyers who act uncivilly  with professional misconduct. The Law Society began an  investigation into Mr. Groia in 2004 for his behaviour toward the prosecution,  even though no one complained. He was charged with professional misconduct in  2009 and found guilty by a Law Society Hearing Panel in 2012. The Law Society  Appeal Panel confirmed this in 2013. Mr. Groia’s licence to practice law was  suspended for a month and he was ordered to pay $200,000 in costs. He disagreed  with the decision and asked the courts to review it. Both the Divisional Court  and the Court of Appeal upheld the Law Society Appeal Panel’s decision. Justice Michael Moldaver, writing  for the majority at the Supreme Court, ruled for Mr. Groia. In his view, the  Law Society’s decision was unreasonable. He said that Mr. Groia had a  reasonable basis to accuse the prosecution of misconduct, even though the  allegations stemmed from his mistaken understanding of the law. The  prosecutors’ conduct, the fact that the judge did not correct him, and the legal  uncertainty about how to raise the issue of abuse of process all led him to act  as he did. Justice Moldaver worried that the Law Society’s decision would make  lawyers think twice about forcefully defending their clients, for fear they could  be charged with misconduct. He also said the Law Society should pay careful  attention to the legal rulings made by a trial judge who, unlike the Law  Society, saw Mr. Groia’s behaviour in person. Four judges agreed with Justice  Moldaver. Justice Suzanne Côté agreed with Justice Moldaver that the Law Society  was wrong to punish Mr. Groia. But unlike the majority, she thought that courts  should not simply accept a law society’s disciplinary decision about a lawyer’s  conduct in the courtroom. This was because letting a law society review in-court  behaviour raises concerns about the role and independence of judges. Justices Karakatsanis, Gascon, and  Rowe disagreed with Justice Moldaver on how to review the Law Society’s  decision and on the outcome. They said it was open to the Law Society to find  Mr. Groia guilty of misconduct. In their view, he had disrupted the trial and  unfairly accused the other side’s lawyers of dishonesty. They said the Law  Society reasonably decided that Mr. Groia’s own mistaken view of the law was no  excuse for his bad behaviour. Lawyers have both a professional  obligation to advocate strongly for their clients and a duty to act civilly  during a trial. This case was about deciding when strong courtroom advocacy  becomes incivility, and when incivility becomes professional misconduct. The  Supreme Court said that decision-makers should look at the full situation when  deciding if a line was crossed."
2018 SCC 26,"<strong>Religious groups don’t need  to have the same fair procedures as public bodies, the Supreme Court has ruled.  Also, courts can’t interfere with their decisions on purely religious  questions.</strong>
     The Highwood Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses is a  religious group with about a hundred members in Calgary. To become a member, a  person must be baptized and show that s/he understands the religious teachings  and lives according to the community’s rules. Anyone who doesn’t follow the rules  will be urged to repent (apologize). If the behaviour continues, a committee of  at least three elders can decide to expel or “disfellowship” the member. The  Congregation calls this committee a “Judicial Committee.”  Randy Wall became a member in 1980. In 2014, the  Judicial Committee disfellowshipped him for sinning and not fully repenting.  The decision was confirmed by an appeal committee and by the Watch Tower Bible  and Tract Society of Canada, the head office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in this  country. Mr. Wall asked the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench to  review the decision. “Judicial review” is when courts look at tribunals’  decisions to make sure they are proper. Courts can only judicially review the  decisions of public bodies (set up by the government and acting on its behalf),  not private ones. When making decisions, public tribunals must treat everyone fairly  and make decisions without bias. This is what is meant by “procedural fairness.”
     Mr. Wall argued that the Judicial Committee acted  unfairly. He said that the decision caused him to lose money because Jehovah’s  Witness clients avoided his real estate business. The lower courts first had to  decide whether they had any power (or legal authority) to review the Judicial  Committee’s disfellowship decision. They decided they did, even though the  Judicial Committee was not a public decision-maker. They decided this due to  the financial impact on Mr. Wall and because the procedure may not have been  fair. Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice Malcolm  Rowe said this was wrong. The courts did not have the power to review the  disfellowship decision of a private, religious organization. Mr. Wall didn’t  have a right to the Congregation members’ business. He also didn’t have a right  to membership in the Congregation that courts could enforce, like a contract. Justice  Rowe confirmed that courts can only review the decisions of public  decision-makers and that private decision-makers don’t have to follow fair  procedures unless an enforceable legal right is at stake. He also confirmed  that disagreements about religious principles are “non-justiciable”—that is, not  appropriate for courts of law to get involved in. This decision confirmed that religious groups can decide  their own membership and rules. Courts cannot interfere with their decisions,  except when needed to resolve an underlying, “justiciable” legal dispute. "
2018 SCC 25,"<strong>The Supreme  Court has refused a man’s request to take back his guilty plea because he didn’t  show what he would have done differently if he’d known he could be deported.</strong>
   Wing Wha Wong came to Canada from  China over 25 years ago, but never became a citizen. He was married and had a  child who was born in Canada. In 2014, he pleaded guilty to cocaine  trafficking. He didn’t know that pleading guilty and being convicted of  trafficking could result in him being deported.  While he was in prison, however, he received  a call from an immigration officer. Because he was not a Canadian citizen, the  officer told him he likely could not stay in Canada because he had committed a  serious crime. A crime is “serious” when its possible prison sentence is ten  years or more, or where a person receives a sentence of more than six months. A  person convicted of cocaine trafficking could get a life sentence. Mr. Wong was  sentenced to nine months. His crime was considered serious—and so he could be  required to leave Canada—for both these reasons. Mr. Wong was told he would  have to attend an immigration hearing when he was released, and could be deported.  Immigration rules also said he could not appeal the deportation for any reason. In criminal law, a guilty plea must  be the person’s own personal decision, it must be clear and specific, and it  must be based on all the necessary (legally relevant) information. An accused  person must understand what might happen once s/he pleads guilty. This includes  punishment, but also non-criminal consequences, such as deportation. A person  who wants to take back an uninformed plea must show that the missing information  was serious and caused him or her harm. Harm occurs where the person shows that  s/he would have decided to go to trial, or pleaded guilty under different  conditions, if s/he had all the necessary information at the time of the plea. After serving his sentence, Mr. Wong  sought to take back his guilty plea, arguing that he did not know he could be deported.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected his arguments because he did not  specifically say he would have chosen to go to trial if he knew this. Mr. Wong  appealed. At the Supreme Court, the majority said  that Mr. Wong should not be able to take his plea back. Justices Michael  Moldaver, Clément Gascon, and Russell Brown, writing together, accepted that Mr.  Wong did not have all the legally relevant information when he pleaded guilty. Like  the Court of Appeal, however, they noted that he didn’t show that he would have  done anything differently. A decision to plead guilty to a crime is deeply  personal. Courts must therefore look at the person, and what s/he specifically  would have done, when deciding whether to allow the person to take back a plea.  They noted that an approach that disregards the deeply personal nature of a  guilty plea, and looks instead at what a person in a similar situation would  have done, would be difficult for courts to apply. One other judge agreed with  Justices Moldaver, Gascon, and Brown. Justice Richard Wagner (who was not  yet Chief Justice when the appeal was heard) disagreed. He would have let Mr.  Wong take his plea back and ordered a new trial. He agreed that Mr. Wong didn’t  have all the necessary information when he decided to plead guilty. Justice  Wagner disagreed that courts should look at the specific accused person.  Instead, he said courts should take a more objective view and look at what a  person in a similar situation might have done. He said Mr. Wong probably would  have done something differently had he known he could be deported, so the  process was not fair. Two judges agreed with Justice Wagner. Most criminal cases end with a  guilty plea. For the justice system to work well, it is important that guilty  pleas be final. But this is unjust when a guilty plea is flawed. This  decision confirms that someone can withdraw a guilty plea by showing s/he did  not have legally relevant information at the time, and would have done  something differently if s/he had it."
2018 SCC 22,"<strong>The Supreme Court has confirmed a fine against a lumber company whose  inaction led to a forest worker’s accidental death. </strong>
   In  2010, West Fraser Mills hired an independent contractor to cut down “trap  trees” to reduce the beetle population on its property. (“Trap trees” are dead  trees used to lure insect pests; the trees are then cut down and destroyed.) The  contractor, in turn, hired a “faller” (tree-cutter) to do the work. The faller  reported to and was supervised by the contractor. The faller was struck by a falling  tree, and later died. An investigation found that tree was dangerous and should  have been removed before the work began. British  Columbia, like other provinces, has a workers’ compensation scheme to prevent  and deal with workplace injuries and deaths. Under the <em>Workers Compensation Act</em>, the government gave the Workers’  Compensation Board of British Columbia broad powers to make rules about  workplace safety. Different actors, including “owners” and “employers,” have  different responsibilities.  In  this case, the Board found that West Fraser Mills failed as an “owner” to  ensure safe work practices. This violated a workplace safety regulation the  Board had adopted. The Board also found the company was an employer, although  not the employer of the faller. Under the Act, only an “employer” could be  fined. The Board fined West Fraser Mills $75,000.  West  Fraser Mills appealed to the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Tribunal. It argued  that the legislation did not allow the Board to adopt this particular  regulation about workplace owners. Therefore, there could be no finding of <em>owner</em> misconduct as a basis for a fine. West  Fraser Mills also argued that because it was not the faller’s employer, and  only employers could be fined, there  were no grounds to fine it. The Tribunal rejected the arguments, but reduced  the fine based on the company’s safety record and because it did not purposely  disregard safety standards. The decision was upheld by the B.C. Supreme Court  and Court of Appeal.  Then-Chief  Justice Beverley McLachlin, writing for the majority at the Supreme Court of  Canada, confirmed the Tribunal’s decision and the fine. She said that the Board  acted reasonably in adopting a regulation to respond to increased deaths in the  forestry sector. In her view, the Board was free to interpret the legislation  in a way that better supported the goal of promoting safety, including adopting  a regulation targeting owners. A more narrow approach would undermine this goal.  Finally, she said that the Board had the authority to impose the fine. This was  in part because West Fraser Mills employed individuals on the site in question.  Five judges agreed with Chief Justice McLachlin. Justice Suzanne Côté, writing in dissent, would have allowed West Fraser  Mills’ appeal. She said that the Board did not have the authority to adopt this  particular regulation or to impose a fine that applied to employers on a  company that only breached its obligations as an owner.  Justices Russell Brown and Malcolm Rowe also  dissented, in separate reasons. They agreed with the majority that the Board  had the authority to adopt the regulation, but would have allowed the appeal  against the fine for the same reasons as Justice Côté. This  case involved courts’ review of an administrative tribunal’s decision. It  confirmed that courts should generally defer to administrative bodies (like the  Board) when those bodies are given wide authority to make regulations."
2018 SCC 19,"<strong>A business that leaves a car unlocked with the keys inside will not  necessarily be responsible when someone is injured after the car is stolen, the  Supreme Court has ruled. The business will only be responsible where it should  have known both that the car could be stolen, and that someone could be injured  due to it being driven unsafely.</strong>     In  a 7-2 decision, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis, writing for the majority,  allowed an appeal by the owner of Rankin’s Garage, which had been held liable  for such an injury by lower courts.  One  evening in July 2006, fifteen year-old J and 16 year-old C were at C’s mother’s  house, drinking and smoking marijuana. C’s mother provided some of the alcohol.  Sometime after midnight, the boys left the house to walk around the town and  steal valuables from unlocked cars. They entered Rankin’s Garage and found an  unlocked car with its keys in the ashtray. Though he did not have a driver’s  licence and had not driven on the road before, C decided to steal the car and  told J to get in. While they were on the highway, the car crashed, and J  suffered a catastrophic brain injury. Rankin’s Garage, C, and C’s mother were  sued for negligence. The  jury found Rankin’s Garage 37% responsible, C 23% responsible, C’s mother 30%  responsible, and J himself 10% responsible for his injuries. The trial judge  had found that the owner of Rankin’s Garage should have known that leaving an  unlocked vehicle with the keys in it could result in intoxicated teenagers like  J getting hurt. It therefore owed J a duty of care. (In law, a duty of care is  a requirement to act reasonably to avoid harm to others. The harm must be  reasonably foreseeable, or the duty will not exist.) The  Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s holding. Rankin’s Garage appealed. The  majority of the Supreme Court noted that there was no consensus in previous  case law on whether a duty of care existed in similar situations. To determine  whether Rankin’s Garage owed J a duty of care, the majority looked at whether  the garage owner should have known that his failure to take care could cause  harm to someone like J. While the garage owner should have known that leaving a  car unlocked with the keys inside could result in it being stolen, the evidence  did not show that he should have known someone could be <em>injured</em> by a stolen car. This is because there was no evidence  suggesting that a stolen vehicle would be driven unsafely—for example,  suggesting that it would be stolen by a young person. The majority noted that  just because something is <em>possible </em>does  not mean that it is reasonably foreseeable under the law. Rankin’s Garage  therefore did not owe a duty of care to J. Justice  Russell Brown, writing for the dissent, disagreed with the majority’s approach  and would have dismissed the appeal. He considered that the garage owner could  have reasonably foreseen that someone could get hurt as a result of his  negligence in leaving keys inside an unattended, unlocked car. This  case turned on the question of what kinds of harm are reasonably foreseeable.  The majority’s decision clarified that a business will only be liable in this  kind of situation where both the theft and the unsafe operation of the stolen  vehicle should have been foreseen. It further indicated that a defendant may  still owe a duty of care even if a plaintiff participates in criminal activity."
2018 SCC 18,"<strong>A Quebec law delaying pay equity for women in female-dominated  workplaces violated  Charter equality rights, the  Supreme Court has ruled, but it declined to strike the law down.</strong>
   In 1996, Quebec passed a law that required  all employers with ten or more employees to ensure pay equity for women by  2001. Pay equity means equal pay for work of equal value. For most employers, the  1996 law meant identifying jobs that are done mostly by women, and comparing  their salaries to the salaries for jobs done mostly by men in the same  workplace. The problem was that there was no way to determine pay equity for  women in workplaces where there were no mostly male jobs for comparison.  Measuring  pay equity in those workplaces was difficult. Quebec gave its Pay Equity Commission  more time to come up with a solution. This meant that women in mostly-female  workplaces waited six years longer for pay equity than women in mixed-gender  workplaces. Some unions went to court to complain that this delay discriminated  against the women who were forced to wait. The trial judge  found that the delay did not violate the women’s equality rights. This was  because the distinction the government made was not based on the women’s sex (a  ground of discrimination listed in the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>). Instead, it was because there was no male  group to compare them to. The Quebec Court of Appeal agreed.  Justice  Rosalie Silberman Abella, for the majority of the Court on this issue, held  that the women’s equality rights were  breached. The delay targeted a group that had suffered systemic discrimination  based on the idea that “women’s work” was worth less than “men’s work.” Delaying access to pay equity for this group  of women was discriminatory because it continued their historic disadvantage in  the workforce. The government’s reasons  for the delay did not matter to the question of <em>whether </em>discrimination happened, but it did matter to deciding  whether the delay was <em>justified</em>. Justice  Abella, along with three other judges, concluded that it was. The delay was intended  to achieve the important objective of finding an effective solution to the  problem of pay inequity. This long-term benefit outweighed the short-term harm.  Justice Suzanne Côté, writing for herself  and three other judges, said that there was no breach of the women’s equality  rights. This distinction was not based on sex, but on the unique situation the  women found themselves in—working in places with no male job classes for  comparison. The law did not discriminate against this group of women. It  actually benefitted them by correcting the lower pay they got due to systemic  discrimination. Quebec was the first province to tackle this difficult aspect  of pay equity and should be encouraged, not punished.  Chief  Justice Beverley McLachlin (as she was when the case was heard) agreed with  Justice Abella that the women’s equality rights had been breached. But she  disagreed that this breach was constitutionally justified. She would have  struck down parts of the law. This case  was decided on the same day as <em><a href=""37347-eng.aspx"">Quebec  (Attorney General) v. Alliance du personnel professionnel et technique de la  santé et des services sociaux</a></em> which struck down other parts of  Quebec’s pay equity laws."
2018 SCC 17,"<strong>For the first time, the Supreme Court has found a pay equity law  unconstitutional because it was discriminatory.</strong>In a 6-3  decision, Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella, writing for the majority, dismissed  an appeal by the Government of Quebec.  To tackle  the problem of wage discrimination against women workers, Quebec passed a law  in 1996 forcing employers with 10 or more employees to give equal pay for work  of equal value. Ten years later, less than half of employers had  complied. Less than two-thirds had even started on a plan. In 2009, Quebec changed  the law to require employers to review their progress on pay equity every five  years through audits. If the audits showed women were not being paid fairly, they  could still only get pay equity every five years, with no back pay for unfair  wages in between. Some unions challenged the new law in court. They said  that making pay equity available only every five years was discriminatory. The  Quebec courts agreed that the law breached women’s equality rights under section  15 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em>.  Justice Abella agreed that the law violated women’s  equality rights. Pay equity is based on the idea that stereotypes  about the role of women in society lead to “women’s work” being valued and paid  less than “men’s work.” Pay equity laws require employers to identify jobs done  mostly by women, and compare their salaries to the salaries for jobs done mostly  by men. Where equal pay is not being given for work of equal value, employers have  pay their women employees to close the gap. By restricting pay  equity to every five years, the law let employers off the hook. The law  continued the disadvantage women already suffered in the workforce. This breach  of women’s equality rights was not constitutionally justified. It continued to  punish women financially for their employers’ failures. Five judges agreed with  Justice Abella. Justices  Suzanne Côté, Russell Brown, and Malcolm Rowe disagreed. They said Quebec’s law  did not breach women’s equality rights. They noted that <em>Charter</em> rights are “negative rights,” meaning that governments do  not have to adopt particular laws—but if they do, those laws must comply with  the <em>Charter</em>. Quebec decided to adopt a  pay equity law, and when it saw that the original scheme was not working, it  chose to replace it with one that would better achieve equal pay for women. In  practice, the changes benefitted women employees and brought them closer to  real pay equity. These judges said that the choice of how to improve Quebec’s  pay equity laws should be left to Quebeckers’ elected representatives, not the  Court. They also noted that back pay was available for unfair wages in between  audits. This case was decided on the same day as <a href=""37002-eng.aspx""><em>Centrale des syndicats du Québec v. Quebec 
    (Attorney General)</em></a> which upheld  other parts of Quebec’s pay equity laws."
2018 SCC 16,"<strong>Courts should look at all relevant circumstances to  determine a child’s “habitual residence,” the Supreme Court has ruled in a case  about the meaning of those words in an international treaty.</strong>
   In  a 6-3 decision written by Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin (as she was when the  case was heard), the Supreme Court provided guidance for courts to determine a  child’s habitual residence under the <em>Convention  on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</em>. The  parents in this case married in Ontario in 2000 and moved to Germany in 2001. They  became permanent residents there and had two children, but later separated. The  children were struggling in school, so the parents decided the mother would  take them to Canada for 16 months to see if things improved. In August 2014, at  the end of the 16 months, the mother did not return the children to Germany.  The father asked the court to order the return of the children. Based on a  court order, the children were eventually returned to Germany in October 2016.  Soon after, the German courts gave the mother sole custody of the children. In  April 2017, the children and the mother returned to Canada. By  the time this case was heard at the Supreme Court, the disagreement between the  mother and father was resolved. However, the questions asked in the appeal were  important, so the Court decided to provide guidance on how to determine a  child’s habitual residence in future cases. This case involved the <em>Convention on the Civil Aspects of  International Child Abduction</em>. Nearly 100 countries are members of the  Convention, including Germany and Canada. The treaty seeks to protect children  by enforcing custody rights and securing children’s quick return to their  country of habitual residence.  Under  Article 3 of the treaty, the children in this case would have to be returned to  Germany if that was their place of habitual residence. The words “habitual  residence” are not defined, and the parents’ main disagreement was about what  those words actually meant. The judge who first heard the case found that the  intentions of the parents were most important. The Divisional Court later found  that the children’s integration into the community was most important. The  Court of Appeal agreed with the first judge. That decision was appealed to the  Supreme Court. The  majority of the Supreme Court held that courts should look at all relevant  considerations   a child’s habitual residence. This includes the child’s links to, and  circumstances in, each country. The circumstances of the parents, including  their intentions, may be considered. However, courts have no definitive list of  factors that they must take into account; they must look at the child’s  complete situation. A court can, however, decline to return a child if an exception  listed in the treaty applies. Determining habitual residence quickly allows  children to be returned as soon as possible. This protects children, deters abduction  by parents, and helps ensure that the proper courts (in the child’s country of  habitual residence) can decide custody and access issues more quickly. Justices  Suzanne Côté and Malcolm Rowe, writing in dissent, disagreed with the majority about  how to determine the habitual residence of the children. They said that in  situations where the parents’ intentions were clear, courts should respect those  intentions. They said this would lead to faster and more predictable decisions,  which is one of the goals of the <em>Convention</em>.  In this case, the parents had signed an agreement that said that the move to  Canada would be temporary. For this reason, Justices Côté and Rowe would have  upheld the rulings of the application judge and the Court of Appeal, which had  found that Germany was the children’s habitual residence. This  case led to changes in the way the Supreme Court deals with international  custody cases. The majority noted that the legal procedures took too long, and  said this was unacceptable because the first goal of the <em>Convention</em> is to bring children home quickly. To prevent future  delays, the Court is making sure that cases like this one will be identified  and sped up. The Court encouraged lower courts to take similar measures. "
2018 SCC 15,"<strong>A law preventing  residents of New Brunswick from stocking up on alcohol from another province is  constitutional, the Supreme Court has ruled. Provinces have flexibility to make  laws to address particular conditions and priorities within their borders. They  can do this even if those laws may incidentally restrict the movement of goods  across their borders. </strong> The Court unanimously allowed the Crown’s  appeal in a case of a New Brunswick man who bought alcohol from neighbouring  Quebec. Section 134(<em>b</em>)  of the New Brunswick’s <em>Liquor Control Act</em> forbids residents from possessing large amounts of alcohol not purchased from  the New Brunswick Liquor Corporation—for example, purchased from other  provinces. The RCMP was watching New Brunswick residents who crossed the border  into Quebec to buy cheaper alcohol. On October 6, 2012, Gerard Comeau drove to  Quebec from his home in New Brunswick to stock up. When he returned to New  Brunswick, Mr. Comeau was stopped by the RCMP with large amounts of beer and  some spirits he bought in Quebec. He was fined $240, plus fees. Mr. Comeau fought the fine. He said that section  121 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> guarantees  free trade across provincial borders. The Crown disagreed. It argued that section  121 was only meant to prevent provinces from charging tariffs or similar costs  at the border. The Crown said the provision did not apply in Mr. Comeau’s  situation. The trial judge, breaking with longstanding Supreme Court precedent,  agreed with Mr. Comeau and dismissed the charge. The New Brunswick Court of Appeal dismissed the  Crown’s request for permission to appeal. The Crown appealed to the Supreme  Court.  The Supreme Court held that while section 121  prohibits laws whose <em>main</em> purpose is  to prevent the movement of goods across provincial borders, it does not prohibit  legislation that has <em>incidental</em> effects on trade. While the New Brunswick law Mr. Comeau challenged restricted  the movement of alcohol across the provincial border, this was not its main  purpose. Its main purpose was to manage the supply and demand of liquor in New  Brunswick. Therefore, the law is constitutional.This case turned on the  meaning of section 121 of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1867</em>. To understand its meaning, the Court looked at the wording, history,  and position of the provision within the Constitution. It also looked at the legal  principles that guide how courts understand the Constitution. The Court  concluded that section 121 prohibits laws restricting inter-provincial trade,  but only where restricting trade is the laws’ main purpose. If section 121 were  understood to guarantee free inter-provincial trade, it would have far-reaching  effects on agricultural supply management, public health prohibitions,  environmental controls, and similar schemes. Section 121 lets provinces enact  these types of measures, as long as their main purpose is not simply to prevent  the importation of goods from other provinces.

2018 SCC 14," <strong>NOTE: </strong>this document contains details that may be  distressing to some readers.<strong>The Supreme Court has upheld first-degree murder convictions for parents  who abused and unlawfully confined a child.</strong>
     A  unanimous Supreme Court dismissed Spencer Jordan’s and Marie-Eve Magoon’s  appeals against their first-degree murder convictions in an oral judgment on  November 27, 2017. The Court’s written reasons, penned by Justices Rosalie  Silberman Abella and Michael Moldaver, were released on April 13, 2018.  The charges in this  case related to the death of six year-old Meika Jordan, who died after spending  a weekend with her father, Spencer Jordan, and her stepmother, Marie-Eve  Magoon. Meika had endured serious abuse in the days before she died, which Ms.  Magoon and Mr. Jordan justified as discipline. Among other things, she had been  deliberately burned, hit in the stomach (with enough force to damage her  internal organs), and suffered several serious blows to her head. She was  ordered to run up and down the stairs as a form of punishment, and beaten when  Mr. Jordan and Ms. Magoon thought she was not complying with their orders. As a  result of her injuries, Meika lost consciousness and died.  Ms. Magoon and Mr.  Jordan were charged with first-degree murder. The trial judge found that they  intended to harm Meika in a way that was likely to cause her death, and that  they were reckless about whether she actually died. They were convicted of  second-degree murder at trial. The trial judge did not find them guilty of  first-degree murder because she was not satisfied that they had unlawfully  confined Meika while inflicting the injuries.  First- and  second-degree murder are related charges. Second-degree murder is the less  serious offence, and is said to be “included” in the charge of first-degree  murder. First-degree murder contains all the elements of second-degree murder,  but in addition requires planning or an aggravating circumstance—in this case,  the aggravating circumstance was Meika’s unlawful confinement in the home.  Despite this “inclusion,”  both charges are considered separately when a criminal judgment is appealed. In  this case, it meant that after trial the Crown could appeal the acquittal for  first-degree murder, while Mr. Jordan and Ms. Magoon could appeal their  convictions for second-degree murder. The Alberta Court of Appeal dismissed Ms.  Magoon’s and Mr. Jordan’s appeals, confirming the conviction for second-degree  murder. However, it also allowed the Crown’s appeal and upgraded the  convictions to first-degree murder.  Mr. Jordan and Ms.  Magoon appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court looked at the issue of unlawful  confinement in the context of a parent-child relationship. They held that  “confinement” does not require a child to be physically bound or locked up, and  that it can just as easily result from controlling conduct. When parents  abuse or harm a child beyond any acceptable form of parenting, they lose legal  authority to restrict the child’s liberty, and may be found guilty of unlawful  confinement. The Supreme Court  agreed with the Court of Appeal that the pair’s acts of “discipline” went far beyond any acceptable  form of parenting, and amounted to abuse. The Court further agreed that Meika was  unlawfully confined by Ms. Magoon and Mr. Jordan. Therefore, the two could be  found guilty of first-degree murder.  This case dealt  with what constitutes unlawful confinement of a child by a parent, in the  context of a criminal charge of first-degree murder. The Court confirmed the  Alberta Court of Appeal’s conviction of both Mr. Jordan and Ms. Magoon for  first-degree murder. The  penalty for first-degree murder is life in prison with no possibility of parole  for 25 years."
2018 SCC 12,"<strong>The offence  of influence peddling includes a promise to influence government to change the  way it operates, the Supreme Court has ruled. The phrase “any matter of  business relating to the government” in the Criminal Code captures activities that go beyond current  government operations, to include those that the government could facilitate.</strong>
     In an 8-1  decision, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis dismissed Bruce Carson’s appeal and  upheld his conviction for influence peddling. Bruce  Carson was formerly a Senior Advisor in the Office of the Prime Minister. In  2010, about a year after leaving that position, he negotiated a deal with H2O  Professionals Inc. where he promised to use his government contacts to help the  company sell water treatment products to First Nations. In exchange, the  company agreed to pay Mr. Carson’s then-girlfriend commissions on the sales.  Mr. Carson promoted the company to First Nations leaders, government officials, and  cabinet ministers and their staff.  Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (as it was called at  the time, or INAC for short) provided funding to First Nations for water  treatment systems like the ones sold by H2O. First Nations themselves  determined how the money would be spent. However, INAC sometimes funded pilot  projects for water treatment systems. Mr. Carson tried to convince INAC to set  up a project to purchase H2O products and pilot them in First Nations communities. Mr. Carson was charged with a fraud against the  government for selling his influence with the government. At trial,  Mr. Carson admitted that he had influence over the government. He also admitted  that he had demanded a benefit for his then-girlfriend in exchange for  promising to help H2O sell its products. He denied, however, that he was  selling his influence in connection with “any matter of business relating to  the government.” The trial judge acquitted Mr. Carson on the basis that  the purchase of water treatment systems by First Nations did not require  government approval or action. That was because First Nations, rather than  government, would decide whether to purchase H2O’s water treatment systems. The  Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that the trial judge’s interpretation was too  narrow. It held that Mr. Carson’s promise was, in fact, related to government  business. It set aside his acquittal and found him guilty. The main question before the Supreme Court was what  counts as a “matter of business relating to the government.” The majority determined  that this phrase should be interpreted broadly. Business relates to the  government if it depends on or could be facilitated by the government, even if  it requires government to change its operations to promote a specific result. Based  on this, the majority held that Mr. Carson’s promise was indeed in connection  with “any matter of business relating to the government.” This was because, while  First Nations did not need government approval to buy H2O products, INAC could  have encouraged such purchases. It could have changed its funding conditions to  benefit the company, or created a pilot project promoting H2O  products—something Mr. Carson pushed for. For these reasons, the majority held  that it was clear Mr. Carson believed that sales of H2O products to First  Nations could be facilitated by the government. In these circumstances, the  majority considered that Mr. Carson undermined the appearance of government  integrity and that he was guilty of influence peddling. Writing in dissent, Justice Suzanne Côté disagreed  that the matter was connected to government business, and would have restored  Mr. Carson’s acquittal. In her view, “a matter of business relating to the  government” must be actually—not just potentially—related to the operational  structures of government in place at the time of the offence. The trial judge  had found that the federal government had given First Nations complete  independence to purchase water treatment systems of their own choosing.  Therefore, Justice Côté agreed with the trial judge that Mr. Carson’s  activities could not be said to be “relating to the government.” In her view,  the <em>Criminal Code </em>sought to protect  government integrity by criminalizing agreements that would pose a risk of  corruption if they were carried out successfully. She held that no such risk existed  where the “matter of business” in question did not actually relate to the  government. This case dealt with the meaning and scope of “any  matter of business relating to the government” in section 121(1)(d) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The majority determined  that business relates to the government if it depends on or could be  facilitated by the government. A broad interpretation is necessary because real  or apparent corruption may  undermine the integrity and transparency that are crucial to democracy."
2019 SCC 67,"<strong>People delivering mail have a right to safe workplaces, but that doesn’t  mean mail routes have to be inspected every year, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Canada  Post delivers mail across Canada. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers  represents its workers. This includes letter carriers, the people who deliver  the mail. The  federal government is responsible for mail under the Constitution. This means  Canada Post has to follow federal labour laws. One of these laws is the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>. Part of that law deals  with workplace health and safety. Its main purpose is to prevent accidents and  injuries at work. The Code said there had to be a committee to find and fix  dangers to workers’ health and safety. The committee had both worker and  employer members. In  2012, the union filed a complaint about a mail depot in Burlington, Ontario. It  said the committee there wasn’t following the Code. It said the committee was  supposed to inspect each part of the workplace at least once a year. The union said  the workplace included all routes mail was carried on and all places it was  delivered. While the complaint was only about Burlington, it could have had  effects across Canada. Canada Post delivered mail to almost 9 million places  along 72 million kilometres of routes. A  Health and Safety Officer looked into the complaint. She agreed with the union.  But the Appeals Officer at the Occupational Health and Safety Tribunal agreed  with Canada Post. He said the committee only had to inspect parts of the  workplace Canada Post controlled. This meant the depot itself. It didn’t  include mail routes or places mail got delivered. The  union asked for “judicial review.” (Judicial review is where a court looks at a  decision by someone acting on behalf of the government.) The Federal Court let  the Appeals Officer’s decision stand. But the Federal Court of Appeal said the  Appeals Officer made mistakes. It said the Health and Safety Officer’s decision  should stand. This meant Canada Post had to inspect all the routes and places  mail was delivered. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the Appeals Officer’s decision should  stand. This meant the committee didn’t have to inspect the mail routes and  places where mail was dropped off every year. The  majority said it was open to the Appeals Officer to make the decision he did. He  had looked very closely at the wording, purpose, and context of the specific  section of the Code dealing with inspections. He understood what the practical  effects of his decision would be. He decided that some parts of the Code applied  in general, to all places where workers had to be during the workday. But some  parts applied only to places that the employer controlled. The section about  inspections was one of these. That meant only places that Canada Post actually  controlled had to be inspected every year.  Under  the Code, Canada Post had to do what it could, in general, to keep workers  safe. Workers could report issues on routes or at places they went to deliver  mail. Laws like the Code should usually be interpreted broadly to help workers.  But broad interpretations only help if they make sense. The purpose of the  inspections was to find and fix dangers. Canada Post didn’t control the mail  routes or most of the places mail was delivered. Many of them were on private  property. If there was a danger, Canada Post didn’t have the power to fix or  change it. Inspecting the routes and delivery places each year wouldn’t make  workers safer.  Courts have a role  in looking at administrative decisions like the Appeals Officer’s. This is  called “judicial review”. When doing judicial review, courts use a “<a href=""37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx"">standard  of review</a>” to decide if the original decision should stand. Between  the time of the hearing and the decision for this case, the Supreme Court  changed how courts look at administrative decisions. In this case, the Court  applied the same standard of review (“reasonableness”) under the new rules as  the lower courts applied under the old ones."
2019 SCC 65 | 2019 SCC 66,"<strong>The Supreme Court has changed how courts look at administrative  (non-court) decisions, to make the law clearer and more predictable.</strong>
   Decisions made by governments, or those acting on their  behalf, are called “administrative decisions.” They are part of “administrative  law.” Most legal decisions that affect people are administrative decisions, not  court ones. An administrative decision can be anything from a  letter from a benefits agency, to a town by-law, to a decision by a tribunal. Administrative  decision-makers often aren’t judges or lawyers. Their decisions usually don’t  look like court decisions. But judges and courts have a role. Under the  Constitution, courts can make sure administrative decision-makers follow the  rules. They do this through a process called “judicial review.”  When a court looks at an administrative decision, it  applies a certain “standard of review.” The standard of review is the legal  approach to analyzing the decision. Which standard applies depends on what kind  of decision it is. But there was a lot of debate about which standard of review  applied in which situation. There was also debate about how each standard  should be applied. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court confirmed there are two standards of  review when a court looks at administrative decisions. These are “reasonableness”  and “correctness.”“Reasonableness” and “correctness” may sound like  normal everyday words. But they have special meanings in law. A “reasonable”  decision is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It has to <em>make sense</em> in light of the law and the  facts. A  “correct” decision is the <em>only right  answer</em> in light of the law and the facts.  The  majority set out a new way for courts to decide whether they need to ask if a  decision is “reasonable,” or whether it needs to ask if it is “correct.” It  also gave courts guidance for looking at “reasonableness.”
     The majority said that the default (usual) standard of  review should be “reasonableness.” This means a court has to look at whether  the decision is “reasonable.” There can be more than one “reasonable” outcome.  Courts have to accept any decision that’s “reasonable.” They have to accept it even  if they would have decided something different themselves. If a decision isn’t  “reasonable,” a court should normally send it back to the decision-maker for  another look. The decision-maker may come to the same result, or something  different. Rarely, a court may just decide to replace the decision-maker’s  outcome with its own. The majority said there are some cases where  decision-makers don’t have to give reasons. But people need to understand the  decisions that apply to them. So it’s usually important for decision-makers to  explain why they made the decision they did.  The majority said there are two exceptions where the  standard won’t be “reasonableness.” The first exception is where lawmakers specifically  say something different. There are two ways they can do this. The first is by  saying in a law which standard applies. The second is giving a right of appeal  to a court. An appeal is different than judicial review, so different standards  apply. These are called “appellate” standards. They are the same standards  courts use to decide appeals from lower court decisions. An “appellate”  standard ends up being a “correctness” standard if a decision is about the law  or the decision-maker’s power to decide the question. The second exception where the standard won’t be  “reasonableness” is for the rule of law. The rule of law is the principle that  everyone should follow the same basic legal rules in society. This includes  constitutional questions. It includes general questions of law that affect the  legal system as a whole. It also includes cases where powers of two  administrative bodies overlap. For all of these, courts have to ask whether the  decision is “correct.” There can only be one “correct” decision. If a decision  isn’t “correct,” the court will always change it without sending it back to the  decision-maker. The Supreme Court creates ""precedents"" that other  courts have to follow. It is the only court that can overturn these precedents. But this is rare. In most cases, the Court interprets laws or decides what  to do when something isn’t clear. In this case, the Court overturned (changed) some  of its past precedents. Precedents are important because they make the law  certain and predictable. But some of the precedents on standard of review  weren’t doing that. The majority overturned those precedents to make the law  clearer and more predictable."

     The Canadian  Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is a federal body. It makes  rules about TV, phone service, and internet on behalf of the government. Some  of the rules deal with “simultaneous substitution” of TV broadcasts. “Simultaneous  substitution” means replacing one station’s broadcast with another’s at the  same time. If a Canadian TV station has the exclusive right to a program in  Canada, under “simultaneous substitution” rules, it can make other stations use  its version. This includes the commercials. Cable and satellite companies have  to use this version on all their channels showing the program. The rules are  meant to give Canadian TV stations a bigger audience. This way, they can make  more money selling advertising. “Simultaneous substitution” isn’t allowed where  it’s not in the public interest. The Super Bowl has  been shown on Canadian TV for over 40 years. Part of the experience has been  the commercials. But, because of “simultaneous substitution,” viewers in Canada  have always seen different commercials than viewers in the United States.  The public told the  CRTC that it wanted to see the US Super Bowl commercials. So the CRTC decided  that “simultaneous substitution” wouldn’t be allowed for the Super Bowl  anymore. In 2015, it made a “policy statement” saying this. It made the official  decision in a “Final Order” in 2016. The Final Order said the change would happen  in 2017. Bell Media bought  the exclusive rights to show the Super Bowl on its CTV stations until 2019.  Bell and the National Football League (which owned the copyright for the Super  Bowl) disagreed with the CRTC’s decision. They said it didn’t have the power to  make it. The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the CRTC, saying its decision  was “reasonable.”  But the majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the Federal Court  of Appeal took the wrong approach. There are specific ways courts have to look  at decisions made on behalf of the government by bodies like the CRTC. For some  decisions, courts “review” the decision. But in this case, the law said the  parties had the right to “appeal.” That meant the court had to treat the CRTC’s  decision the same way it would treat a court decision. It had to look at  whether the decision was “correct” in light of the law. (To better understand what  “reasonable” and “correct” mean here, read the <a href=""37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx"">“Case  Law in Brief” on the Standard of Review</a>.) The majority agreed with Bell and the NFL. They said the CRTC didn’t  have the power to make the decision. The decision was made under a specific  section of the <em>Broadcasting Act</em>. The  majority read the words of that section in their entire context. It looked at  its wording and grammar, the purpose of the Act, and what Parliament intended  when it passed it. It said that section only gave the CRTC power to order cable  and satellite companies to carry specific <em>channels</em>.  As part of that power, it could create terms and conditions the companies had  to follow. Part of the reason for the section was to support Canadian content  that cable and satellite companies might not consider profitable.  In this case, the CRTC was saying cable and satellite companies carrying  US stations had to broadcast the US version of the Super Bowl, including the  commercials. This was beyond the powers the CRTC had under that section of the  Act. Going beyond its powers made the decision not “correct.” The majority  didn’t decide whether the CRTC could make the decision under a different  section of the Act, though.The <em>Bell Canada </em>and <em>NFL </em>cases were two of three cases known as the “administrative law  trilogy.” (The other case, <em><a href=""37748-eng.aspx"">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em>, was about  whether someone was a Canadian citizen.) The Super Bowl ad cases and <em>Vavilov</em> were about very different  issues. But they all dealt with an area of administrative law called “standard  of review.” To learn more about this (and to better understand the Court’s  reasons in these cases), read the <a href=""37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx"">“Case  Law in Brief” on the Standard of Review</a>.

2019 SCC 65,"<strong>A person born in Canada to parents who were undercover  Russian spies is a Canadian citizen, the Supreme Court has ruled. </strong>
   Mr. Vavilov was born in Toronto in 1994. In 2010, his  parents were arrested for spying in the United States, where they were living. Mr.  Vavilov learned then that his parents had been undercover Russian spies his  whole life. The United States sent the parents back to Russia as part of a spy  exchange. Mr. Vavilov tried to renew his Canadian passport. He  was rejected twice. Officials said he needed proof he was Canadian, and his  birth certificate wasn’t enough. He needed a certificate of Canadian citizenship.  He got this and applied again. But he still didn’t get a passport. Instead, he  got a letter from the Registrar of Citizenship. The Registrar makes the final  decision on who is a Canadian citizen. The letter said giving Mr. Vavilov the certificate  of citizenship was a mistake and that he was not a Canadian citizen. The Registrar’s decision was based  on her view of the <em>Citizenship Act</em>.  The general rule is that anyone born in Canada is a Canadian citizen. But there  is an exception. This exception applies to a child of “a  diplomatic or consular officer or other representative or employee in Canada of  a foreign government.” If neither parent is a Canadian citizen or permanent  resident, the child won’t be a citizen. The  Registrar said the exception applied in Mr. Vavilov’s case.  The Registrar relied on a report  for her decision. The report was written by a junior analyst. The analyst noted  there was no definition of “other representative or employee in Canada of a  foreign government” in the Act. But she said it could include undercover spies.  The analyst recommended the Registrar cancel Mr. Vavilov’s certificate of  citizenship. Mr. Vavilov asked the Federal Court to review the  Registrar’s decision. The Federal Court ruled for the Registrar. It said the decision  was “correct.” The Federal Court of Appeal ruled for Mr. Vavilov. It said the  decision was “unreasonable” and quashed (canceled) it. (To better understand  what “correct” and “unreasonable” mean here, read the <a href=""37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx"">“Case  Law in Brief” on the Standard of Review</a>.) All the judges at the Supreme Court said the  Registrar’s decision was “unreasonable” and that the Federal Court of Appeal  was right to quash it. They said Mr. Vavilov was a Canadian citizen. The judges said the Registrar didn’t justify her view  of the law. They said she didn’t properly consider lawmakers’ debates, court  cases, the text of the <em>Citizenship Act</em>,  and international law. These sources showed that the exception was only meant  to apply to people who had diplomatic “privileges and immunities.”
   Citizens have to follow all their country’s rules. For  example, Canadian citizens have to pay Canadian taxes and obey Canadian laws. But  people working for foreign governments, like at embassies or consulates, don’t  always have to. They may have “privileges and immunities.” These are like  exceptions to the rules that citizens have to follow. They are meant to make  sure one country can’t meddle in another country’s foreign policy through its  officials. The officials need the privileges and immunities to do their jobs  properly. That’s why diplomats and other foreign representatives to Canada can’t  become Canadian citizens.  The majority said it didn’t matter that Mr. Vavilov’s  parents were working for a foreign state. What mattered was whether they had  privileges and immunities. They didn’t. That meant the exception didn’t apply  to Mr. Vavilov. Normally, if a court finds an administrative decision  unreasonable, it will send it back to the decision-maker to try again. In this  case, the majority said it wouldn’t be useful to do that. Mr. Vavilov had  already brought up all these issues and nothing changed the Registrar’s mind. The  judges said that Mr. Vavilov was a Canadian citizen.  This case was one of  three cases known as the “administrative law trilogy.” (The other two cases,  decided in <em><a href=""37896-37897-eng.aspx"">Bell  Canada v. Canada (Attorney General)</a></em>, were about Super Bowl ads.) <em>Vavilov</em> and the Super Bowl ad cases  were about very different issues. But they all dealt with an area of  administrative law called “standard of review.” To learn more about this (and  to better understand the Court’s reasons in this case), read the <a href=""37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx"">“Case  Law in Brief” on the Standard of Review</a>."
2019 SCC 63,"<strong>The federal government couldn’t force a BC Crown  corporation to pay GST on its own property, but it still had to pay because BC  agreed, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   British  Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) was a Crown corporation owned  by the British Columbia government. BCI managed and invested pension and other money  for several public-sector organizations. The  federal government collected GST under the <em>Excise  Tax Act</em>. BCI didn’t charge direct fees for some of its investment services.  Instead, it took some of the profits from those investments to cover the costs  of its services. It didn’t charge GST.  Under  the Constitution, the federal and provincial governments each have different  powers. They can’t interfere with each other’s powers. The Constitution says  that they can’t force each other to pay tax. They have “immunity” against each  other’s taxes. But  the federal government said BCI had to charge GST for the investment services. According  to the federal government, BCI was holding the investments “in trust” for (for  the benefit of) pension boards. The pension boards were private and not part of  any government. Because the pension boards were getting a service, the federal  government said they had to pay GST, which BCI had to collect.  The  federal government also said BCI still had to pay GST even if the investments  weren’t being held “in trust” for anyone else. This was because the BC  government had agreed to pay GST in some situations. According to the federal  government, BCI was bound by BC’s agreement to pay GST. The federal government  said BCI owed over $40 million, plus interest and penalties, for three years. BCI  asked a British Columbia court to legally declare that it didn’t have to pay  federal taxes. The BC court decided the federal government couldn’t force BCI  to pay under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>. But  the court also said that BCI still had to pay because of BC’s agreements with  the federal government. The Court of Appeal agreed. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed with the lower courts.  BC law didn’t actually say who the “beneficiary” of the trust was (that is, who  got the real benefits from it). BCI legally owned the investments. BCI was a  Crown corporation managing the investments. So if the federal government  charged BCI GST for investment services under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>, it would be charging tax on property owned by the  province. That’s not allowed under the Constitution. But  the majority of judges agreed that BCI still had to pay because it was a  provincial Crown corporation. Just as it benefitted from the province’s tax  immunity, it was also bound by the province’s agreements to pay GST to the  federal government. The majority said that even though one level of government  can’t force the other to pay tax, that doesn’t mean they can’t <em>agree</em> to pay tax if they choose to. Another issue in  this case was which court should decide the dispute. The Tax Court is the only  court that has the power to decide if a federal tax assessment is correct. Because  it is a provincial superior court, the BC court has the power to hear any legal  issue, unless the power to hear it has been given to another court. The issue  about whether BC’s agreements to pay GST applied to BCI wasn’t about a specific  tax assessment, so the Tax Court wouldn’t have had the power to decide it. Since  it made sense to hear all the issues together, it was right for the BC court to  hear it."
2019 SCC 62,"<strong>Quebec family property rules apply to a family home held by a trust that  one of the spouses controls, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   When  people get married in Quebec, a “family patrimony” is created. It usually  includes property such as family homes, cars, and furniture. These can be owned  by both spouses, or by just one spouse. It can also include a family home that  a spouse doesn’t own, but has rights to use. Under Quebec’s <em>Civil Code, </em>“rights which confer use”  are included in the family patrimony. If the marriage ends, family patrimony  almost always gets divided equally between the spouses. Mr.  Karam and Ms. Yared got married in 1998. They had four children together. In  2011, Ms. Yared was diagnosed with incurable cancer. Mr. Karam decided to set  up a trust for the benefit of the children.  In  Quebec law, a trust is a patrimony without an owner. It doesn’t belong to  anyone. A trust can have settlors, trustees, and beneficiaries who create,  control, and benefit from it. But the property in the trust never becomes part  of anyone’s personal patrimony. When Mr. Karam set up the trust, he didn’t do  it to avoid any rules of family patrimony. He just wanted to protect the family  assets. In  2012, the spouses put money in the trust to buy a home in Montreal. The home  was worth over $2 million. Mr. Karam said he wanted to buy a house that could  be both the family home and an investment that would benefit the children. In  2014, Ms. Yared left the family home and filed for divorce. She made a will and  divided her estate into four trusts, one for each of the children. She died in  2015, before the divorce was finalized.  Ms.  Yared’s brothers were the liquidators (executors) of her estate. In 2016, they  asked a court to include the value of the home held by the trust in the family  patrimony. If either spouse had owned the home, it would have been part of the  family patrimony. But Mr. Karam said it shouldn’t be included because the trust  owned it. The  trial judge said the value of the home should be included, even though neither  spouse directly owned it. The Court of Appeal disagreed and said it shouldn’t  be included. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the value of the home should be  included in the family patrimony. They said that even though neither spouse  owned the family home, Mr. Karam had “rights which confer use” to it. Even though  trustees don’t own the property in a trust, the control they have over it may  give them “rights which confer use.” In this case, the majority found that Mr.  Karam had control over the family home. He had the power to decide who could  use the home and who had a right to its value.  The  majority said it didn’t matter whether a spouse transferred the home to a trust  or, as in this case, the trust purchased the home directly. Rules  around family patrimony are rules of “public order.” That means people can’t get  around them, for example by signing a contract that says something different.  They apply no matter what. This is because the rules are meant to protect  vulnerable spouses and put them on equal footing when a marriage ends. Trusts are an  example of the effect Canada’s two major legal traditions, common law and civil  law, have on each other. Trusts are a common law concept. But they were  introduced into Quebec civil law with the new <em>Civil Code</em> in the 1990s. A common law trust is a kind of shared  ownership. But a civil law trust is the transfer of property to an independent patrimony  that nobody owns. "
2019 SCC 61,"<strong>The Supreme Court issued written dissenting reasons in  a case decided orally by the majority of judges in December 2019.</strong>
     Instrubel was a Dutch company. It had a dispute about  contracts with the Republic of Iraq. It took the dispute to arbitration (a  non-court process often used to settle international contract cases). In 2003,  Iraq was ordered to pay Instrubel $32 million plus interest. Iraq didn’t pay. In  2013, Instrubel asked a Quebec court for help to get payment. It said Iraq had  money in Quebec. Soon after, it asked the  court to seize money from the International Air Traffic Association (IATA). IATA collected fees from airlines on behalf of  different countries, for the right to fly over and into those countries. One of  the countries IATA collected fees for was Iraq. IATA wasn’t involved in the  fight between Iraq and Instrubel. But its headquarters were in Montreal. This  meant Quebec courts had jurisdiction (power) over it.  Quebec has rules to help make  sure people ordered to pay others actually do so. For example, the court can  order a third party to pay a debt it owes to another person to someone else.  (It can also make the third party hand over certain kinds of property belonging  to the person.) The court can also order the money to be seized to make sure  it’s still there by the time the final decision is given. In this case, IATA  could be ordered not to pay its debt until the court made a final decision.  Then it would either pay it to Instrubel or Iraq, depending on who won the  case. IATA told the court it didn’t have any money or  property that belonged to Iraq. But less than a week before, it held $166  million (US dollars) for the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority. The court said  IATA had to transfer $90 million (Canadian dollars) to a bank account in Quebec.  It would stay there until the final decision. IATA asked for the seizure to be  quashed (canceled). The judge who heard the issue said the money couldn’t be  seized. He said Quebec courts didn’t have jurisdiction (power) to seize money  that was outside of Quebec when the court order was issued. He also said the  money IATA collected for Iraq wasn’t a debt, so it couldn’t be seized under  Quebec law. The Court of Appeal overturned the judge’s decision.  Among other things, it said the money could be seized and said it was a debt. It  said the debt legally existed at IATA’s headquarters in Montreal. This was true  even if the money was collected in another place and was held in a bank account  somewhere else.  The Supreme Court decided this case “from the bench”  right after the hearing on December 11, 2019.  When a case is decided “from the bench,” it means an  oral decision is given right away. The parties don’t have to wait for a written  decision, which takes some time (an average of about five months in 2019).  About a third of decisions were given from the bench in 2019. When a case is decided from the bench, the Court will sometimes  give a written explanation (reasons) later. This can be done to make things  more clear. In most cases, though, there won’t be written reasons. This doesn’t  mean there is no explanation. When giving the oral decision, the Court might  give a short explanation, or say something like, “we allow (or dismiss) this  appeal substantially for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal.” That means it’s  relying on the reasons of the lower court, which basically got it right. In this case, the majority of judges dismissed Iraq’s  and IATA’s appeals “substantially for the reasons of the Court of Appeal.” They  didn’t give their own written reasons. The Court of Appeal’s decision stayed in  effect. That meant the money could be seized from IATA. One judge disagreed and said she  would give written reasons later. It doesn’t happen often that there are only written  reasons for a dissent, when a judgment is from the bench. But dissent is an  important part of Canada’s judicial process.  This case was about  enforcing an international arbitration decision. Quebec courts weren’t involved  in the original decision. But they heard the case because it was important to  support international arbitration. This included support to make sure awards  got paid."
2019 SCC 60,"<strong>Companies are responsible for the cost of complying  with environmental orders, not the government, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   In the 1960s, there was a pulp and paper mill in  Dryden, Ontario. A plant on the site produced chemicals to bleach the paper. The  process involved using mercury. At the end of the process, the waste was dumped  into nearby rivers. The mercury flowed downstream, where it poisoned people.  Residents of the Grassy Narrows and Islington First Nations suffered serious,  long-term health effects. In 1977, two First Nations bands sued for damage from  the mercury contamination. By the late 1970s, the mill and plant were owned by a  company called Reed. Another company, Great Lakes Forest Products, was  interested in buying the properties. But it wasn’t sure about buying because of  the lawsuit. A site had been built to safely bury the waste. Samples were taken  and tested regularly to make sure there were no leaks. But Great Lakes didn’t  want to be held responsible for past pollution. The provincial government was afraid the local economy  would suffer if the pulp and paper mill closed, so it wanted the sale to go  through. It said it would give Great Lakes an “indemnity.” An indemnity is a  kind of financial protection. In this case, the government agreed to cover costs  above $15 million to settle legal claims for past pollution. In exchange, Great  Lakes agreed to spend about $200 million to expand and upgrade the mill. The  sale, with the indemnity agreement, went through in 1979.  The First Nations’ lawsuit ended in 1985. As part of  the settlement, the government gave Great Lakes and Reed a new indemnity. It  covered all claims due to previous pollution damage, including the mercury. It replaced  the one from 1979 (and another from 1982). It applied to anyone who might take  over the mill later. In 2009, Bowater owned the waste disposal site, which  was now separate from the mill. It filed for bankruptcy. As part of this  process, a court allowed it to abandon the site in 2011. But the Ontario Ministry  of the Environment said Bowater and Weyerhaeuser (the previous owner) still had  responsibilities. It ordered them to repair the waste disposal site, keep  monitoring and testing, and take steps to prevent and deal with leaks. Weyerhaeuser said the indemnity  from the 1985 settlement applied to the order. It said the provincial  government had to pay for all the costs of complying. Bowater, which had become  Resolute Forest Products, said the same thing.  The motion judge said the indemnity applied to the  order. That meant the government had to cover the cost. The majority at the  Court of Appeal said it applied but Resolute couldn’t claim it. It said the  lower court should decide whether Weyerhaeuser could. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the  indemnity didn’t apply to the order. That meant Resolute and Weyerhaeuser had to  cover the costs of complying with it. The majority noted that the 1985 agreement didn’t say  the government would cover the company’s costs of following environmental  rules. It also wasn’t meant to cover claims between the government and the  company. It was only supposed to cover claims by third parties (that is, people  who didn’t sign the agreement). The majority noted that the indemnity referred to  “pollution claims.” But this wasn’t a pollution claim. There were no leaks and  so no new pollution had happened. The order was about monitoring and testing to <em>prevent</em> more pollution. The majority  said the indemnity was meant to cover claims for new pollution or for mercury  already present in the environment from before. It didn’t mean claims for the  mercury safely contained in the waste disposal site. The motion judge said  mercury was leaking from the site, but this was a mistake.  The  motion judge also said that the government gave the indemnity in 1985 as part  of an exchange. In return, Great Lakes would invest in the Dryden plant. But  this was a mistake. Great Lakes had already agreed to make this investment in  1979. It didn’t make any new commitments for the 1985 indemnity. The motion  judge made his decision on the wrong facts, so the majority at the Supreme  Court was allowed to change it.  This case dealt with  a company that was going bankrupt. Companies can still be responsible for  following environmental rules even when they go bankrupt."
2019 SCC 59,"<strong>Police weren’t allowed to arrest someone for not holding an escalator  handrail, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   In  2009, Ms. Kosoian went into a subway (metro) station on her way to downtown  Montreal. There was a sign by the escalator saying “caution” and “hold handrail,”  with a picture of someone holding a handrail. While going down the escalator,  Ms. Kosoian was looking in her bag for money to buy her ticket. She wasn’t  holding the handrail. Constable Camacho saw her and told her to hold the  handrail. She didn’t, because she didn’t think she had to. When she got to the  bottom, Constable Camacho stopped her. He asked her to follow him into a holding  room so he could give her a ticket for her conduct. She refused, because she  didn’t think she had done anything wrong. Constable Camacho and another officer  grabbed her and took her to the room. They asked her for identification. She  said no, and asked to call a lawyer.  Constable Camacho said Ms. Kosoian was under arrest.  The officers handcuffed her and forced her to sit on a chair with her hands  crossed behind her back. They searched her bag without permission. She was  upset, but calmed down when the officers told her there was a surveillance  camera in the room. They gave her two fines amounting to hundreds of dollars.  The fines were for disobeying the picture and preventing the officers from  doing their jobs.  The next day, Ms. Kosoian’s spouse filed a complaint  with the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), which ran the subway. He asked  for the surveillance tapes. The STM never responded, and the tapes were  automatically erased after five days. Ms. Kosoian went to a doctor, who said  she had post-traumatic stress and a sprained wrist from the incident. She was  later found not guilty in municipal court and didn’t have to pay the fines for  the tickets. Ms.  Kosoian thought the arrest was illegal, and sued. She said Constable Camacho,  his employer (the City of Laval), and the STM were all responsible.  The  trial judge and the majority at the Court of Appeal said Constable Camacho didn’t  act wrongly, based on the information and training he had. They said the arrest  wasn’t illegal. They said Ms. Kosoian caused her own problems by not  cooperating. The  Supreme Court unanimously disagreed. It said the picture was a warning. There  was no law saying people had to hold the handrail. Ms. Kosoian didn’t have to  obey the picture. Constable Camacho was wrong to stop and search her for  breaking a law that didn’t exist. The City of Laval was responsible as his  employer. The STM was wrong for not training him properly. The STM taught police officers that pictures in subway  stations showed legal rules. But some were just warnings. Those that were legal  rules and really had to be obeyed had clues. For example, one picture showed  the amount of the fine with an image of a gavel to suggest a court of law (even  though Canadian judges don’t use gavels). The handrail picture didn’t have  this. In any case, there was no government law or by-law saying people had to  hold escalator handrails. The  Court said the STM training partly explained why Constable Camacho believed  holding the handrail was a legal rule, and why he acted the way he did. But police  officers still have to use their own judgment. Before stopping Ms. Kosoian,  Constable Camacho should have made sure he had a real legal basis for doing so.  A reasonable police officer should have known that people didn’t have to hold  handrails. Or at least they should have had some doubt. Police officers are  allowed to assume that rules they are asked to enforce may be enforced. They  aren’t allowed to assume a rule <em>exists</em> just because they are told so. The Court said Constable Camacho and the STM were  equally responsible for what happened. Even if Ms. Kosoian didn’t act in the  best way, she had no legal obligation to hold the handrail. That meant she  didn’t have to cooperate and was allowed to walk away. The Court said Ms.  Kosoian should get $20,000 for the harm she suffered.  This  case was about civil liability for doing something wrong. In a free and  democratic society, police officers can’t interfere with people’s freedoms  except where the law says so. They have to know the law and act within it."
2019 SCC 58,"<strong>Provincial contract law, not federal maritime law, applied to a contract  for ship-engine parts, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Desgagnés  Transport was a shipping company in Quebec. Wärtsilä was a company that made  and sold ship engines. In 2006, Desgagnés Transport ordered $1 million in parts  from Wärtsilä to fix a ship engine. The contract said Wärtsilä would only have to  pay up to €50,000 if the parts didn’t work. Three years later the shiphad a major engine failure. One of the  parts had been faulty all along. Desgagnés Transport sued Wärtsilä for the cost  of repairing the ship and for its lost profits. The total was over $5.6  million. The  issue in this case was which body of law applied. When parties make a contract,  they can say which  law they want to apply. Since they both agree to it by signing the contract,  courts will generally respect the choice. In this case, the contract didn’t say  which law applied, so the courts had to decide. There were two  possibilities. The first was provincial contract law. In Quebec, this is the  civil law found in the <em>Civil Code</em>. Under  these rules, Wärtsilä would not be able to limit its liability (its legal  responsibility) by saying so in the contract. This meant it would be liable for  the defective part and would have to pay Desgagnés Transport the full cost. The  second possibility was federal maritime law. This is a separate system of law,  like common law or civil law, and covers all kinds of disputes closely tied to  navigation and shipping. If federal maritime law applied, Wärtsilä wouldn’t be liable  for the defective part. It would only have to pay what the contract said.  The  reason two possible bodies of law could apply was that provincial and federal  governments have different powers. These are set out in Canada’s Constitution. The  Constitution says the federal government has power over navigation and  shipping. Provincial governments have power over property and civil rights. Contracts  usually fall under provincial powers. The trial judge said provincial contract law applied. The  majority of the Court of Appeal said federal maritime law applied.  All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that provincial contract law applied.  (Though some said this for very different reasons.) That meant Wärtsilä had to  pay the full $5.6 million. The  majority noted that issues can’t always be divided easily into federal or  provincial powers. In these cases, courts must be flexible. Where there is  overlap, they try to make sure both levels of government have as much of a role  as possible.  The  majority said selling ship-engine parts fell under federal maritime law. This  was because it is closely tied to navigation and shipping, a federal power.  However, selling goods is also covered by property and civil rights, which the  provinces have power over. In constitutional law, a situation like this is  called a “double aspect scenario.” It means both levels of government have  power at the same time. If this happens, courts will look at whether there is any  reason why only one government’s power should apply. In constitutional law, two  possible reasons are “interjurisdictional immunity” and “federal paramountcy.” “Interjurisdictional  immunity” is when something goes to the core of a power, so the other level of  government isn’t allowed to impair (lessen) it. In that case, one government  has “immunity” from the other’s power. “Federal paramountcy” applies when laws  passed by federal and provincial governments are at odds. It means federal law  prevails, and the parts of provincial law that go against it aren’t applied.  In  this case, the majority said contracts for ship-engine parts didn’t go to the  core of navigation and shipping. That meant the federal power didn’t have  immunity from the provincial power. So the first reason (interjurisdictional  immunity) didn’t apply. For the second reason, the majority noted that federal  paramountcy is meant to make sure provincial legislatures don’t override the  federal Parliament. But federal maritime law is mostly based on court decisions  and custom, not laws written and passed by Parliament. Court decisions and  custom can’t trump laws created by legislatures, like Quebec’s <em>Civil Code</em>. That meant the second reason,  federal paramountcy, didn’t apply. So, provincial contract law applied and Wärtsilä had to pay the full  $5.6 million. Maritime law has both common  and civil law roots. It is one of the oldest bodies of law. While maritime  cases used to be heard in their own separate courts, today they are heard by  regular courts. "
2019 SCC 57,"<strong>The City of Montreal had to pay a company for services it provided even  though municipal contract rules weren’t followed, the Supreme Court has said.</strong>
   The  City of Montreal was planning a big event in May 2007 to launch its  transportation plan. Less than a month before the event, city officials  realized they needed help. They contacted Octane, a public relations and  communications firm. Mr. Thériault, who worked in the mayor’s office, asked  Octane to do some work. Octane got another company, PGB, to help. Octane sent the  city an estimate for about $83,000 for the work PGB would do. The event was a  success. Octane paid PGB the $83,000. Octane sent invoices to the city for its services. The  city paid three of them, but refused to pay the one for PGB’s work. It said  there was no contract between the city and Octane, and Octane made the contract  with PGB on its own.  In  May 2010, Octane sued the city to get the $83,000. On top of there being no  contract, the city said because the services were for more than $25,000, by law  it had to invite other companies to bid. Because rules were broken, it said the  contract wasn’t allowed and it didn’t have to pay. Octane added Mr. Thériault  to the lawsuit, in the hope that he might be ordered to pay if the city wasn’t. The trial judge said there was a contract between  Octane and the city. But he said rules were broken. This meant the contract had  to be annulled (cancelled and treated like it never existed). Annulling the  contract meant Octane should get “restitution of prestations” (the last word  pronounced “press-TAY-shuns”). “Restitution” means giving something back when a  person has gained something they shouldn’t have from someone else. A  “prestation” is a payment, either in money or services. So “restitution of  prestations” means giving back a payment that shouldn’t have been made. It is  meant to return everyone to their original positions. Since the city couldn’t  return the exact services Octane provided, it had to pay their fair value. The  trial judge said only the city had to pay, not Mr. Thériault. The  Court of Appeal agreed. It said that since the contract had to be annulled, the  parties had to be put back in their original positions. The majority added that  even if no contract ever existed, this could still be done under the rules of  “receipt of a payment not due.” Under these rules, a court can make someone  give back a payment if it wasn’t owed and was either made by mistake or to  prevent something bad from happening. It is another way to get restitution of  prestations. The majority at the Supreme Court said the city had to  pay Octane the $83,000 based on receipt of a payment not due. A  major question was whether the rules on restitution of prestations applied to cities  and towns. The city argued that special rules applied to municipal governments,  to protect the public interest (and public money). All three levels of court said  restitution of prestations applied to cities and towns. The Supreme Court  majority said the public interest was protected. This was because courts could  decide not to order restitution of prestations (or to order a different amount)  if someone would get an advantage that they shouldn’t. The  majority said the trial judge made a legal mistake in deciding there was a  contract. Since the city didn’t follow the proper process to agree to a deal, no  contract ever existed under the law. Because no contract existed, it couldn’t  be annulled. That meant restitution couldn’t be ordered on the basis of a null (annulled)  contract. But restitution can be based on other things. The majority agreed  that it could be based on the city receiving a payment that wasn’t due. The  “payment” was the events services Octane provided through PGB. Octane provided  the services because it believed it had to. It thought (mistakenly) it had a  contract with the city. That meant it should get an equal value for its  services back. The  majority didn’t need to decide whether Mr. Thériault should pay because it said  the city had to. But it said officials like him might have to pay in some  situations. This case was  decided based on specific rules of Quebec’s <em>Civil  Code</em>.The Supreme Court recently  looked at “receipt of a payment not due,” in a different context, in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37893-eng.aspx"">Threlfall v.  Carleton University</a></em>."
2019 SCC 55,"<strong>Time limits for adult criminal trials also apply  to youth criminal trials, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   In  April 2015, KJM was 15 years old. He got into a fight and stabbed someone in  the face and head with a box cutter. He was charged with several crimes. He  said it was self-defence and pleaded not guilty.  KJM’s  trial was set for September 2015. But an issue about some evidence came up that  had to be dealt with. The earliest date available to deal with it was six  months later. But KJM came to court late that day, and there wasn’t time to  finish. The next available date was about four months later. There was also a  delay when a transcript wasn’t ready.  In  the meantime, the Supreme Court released an important decision, <em>R. v. Jordan</em>. <em>Jordan </em>set out new rules to decide how long is too long for a  criminal trial. In Canada, everyone charged with a crime has the right to be  tried in a reasonable time. This right comes from section 11(b) of the<em> Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, part of  Canada’s Constitution. If the time between the charge and the end of trial is  too long, the court can stop the prosecution. This is called a “stay of  proceedings.”<em> Jordan</em> said most trials  should finish either 18 or 30 months after a person is charged, depending on  the type of trial. If a trial takes longer, it should be “stayed” unless the  Crown (the prosecution) can show a good reason why it should continue. A trial taking  less time can still be stayed if the defence tried to move things along and the  trial took “markedly” (a lot) longer than it should have. <em>Jordan </em>also created special rules for cases already in progress  when the rules changed, like KJM’s. These were called “transitional” cases.  In  October, just over 18 months after he was charged, KJM asked for a stay. According  to <em>Jordan</em>, he argued, his trial  should have finished earlier. The trial judge disagreed. KJM was found guilty  of assault and weapons crimes soon after. The  majority of the Court of Appeal agreed KJM’s trial hadn’t taken too long. The Supreme Court had  to decide if the <em>Jordan</em> time limits for  adult criminal trials also applied to youth criminal trials. The majority said they  do. It said the <em>Jordan </em>rules are  flexible enough to apply to everyone, no matter what their situation. But the majority noted that timely trials are especially important for young  people. Young  people tend to be more short-sighted about consequences than adults. They need  the opportunity to grow during their teenage years. Long trials create stress and anxiety and  get in the way of positive change. The majority said that the entire youth criminal  justice system needs to respect this. <strong> </strong>
     The majority also said judges need  to consider a person’s age when a trial takes less than 18 or 30 months. Each  case is different, but a trial that isn’t too long for an adult can be too long  for a young person.  In this case, the total  time between when KJM was charged and when he was found guilty was almost 19  months. The majority said this wasn’t actually over the <em>Jordan </em>time limit. This was because, under the <em>Jordan </em>rules, three to four months were deducted for delays caused  by the defence and the transcript problem. The majority  said that while the defence did try to move things along quickly, it wasn’t  convinced the trial took a lot longer than it should have. The majority also considered  the fact that <em>Jordan </em>came out 15 months after KJM was  charged. That made his case “transitional”. In the end, the majority said the trial  judge’s decision should stand. Even though it didn’t  apply to KJM, the majority said time taken to deal with young offenders outside  court shouldn’t count toward the <em>Jordan </em>time  limits. This includes time  taken for things like counselling or community service programs. This is to encourage other ways  of dealing with youth crime, which may have better results. This case was about  the right to be tried in a reasonable time. The right doesn’t just benefit  people charged with crimes. It also protects the rights of victims, witnesses,  and society as a whole. Victims and witnesses benefit from less worry and  frustration when trials happen faster, and they can move on. Society benefits  when justice happens quickly and people charged with crimes are treated fairly."
2019 SCC 54,"<strong>An experienced naturopath wasn’t guilty when one of  her patients died after treatment, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Ms. Javanmardi worked as a naturopath in Quebec for  over 20 years. She had a degree in science. She  also had a doctorate and diploma in naturopathic medicine. Her education included  classes and clinical training about intravenous injections. She gave these  injections to thousands of patients while working as a naturopath. While  naturopaths are allowed to give injections in other provinces, they aren’t  allowed to in Quebec.  In 2008, Mr. Matern visited Ms. Javanmardi’s clinic.  He was 84 and had heart disease. He was frustrated with the treatment he got at  regular medical clinics and hoped naturopathy would help. Ms. Javanmardi recommended  an intravenous injection. Mr. Matern asked for one right away. It turned out that one of the vials  Ms. Javanmardi used for the injection was contaminated. Mr. Matern died later  that night. Two other patients got injections from the same vial that day  without any problems. Ms. Javanmardi was charged with two crimes. The first was “unlawful act  manslaughter.” This means doing something illegal that causes someone to die.  The second was “criminal negligence causing death.” This means doing something that  a “reasonable person” wouldn’t have done that causes someone to die. Both  charges were based on the fact that Ms. Javanmardi gave Mr. Matern an  injection.  To be guilty of a crime, a person must do something  that is against the (criminal) law. But something has to make them <em>responsible</em> for what they’ve done. For  many crimes, responsibility is based on meaning to do something wrong. But for  some crimes, a person can be responsible even if they don’t mean to do anything  wrong. In these cases, a judge will compare what the person did to what a  “reasonable person” would have done in the same situation. If the actions of  the accused person and the “reasonable person” are very different, the judge  can decide the accused person didn’t take proper care.  The  trial judge found Ms. Javanmardi not guilty on both charges. She said Ms. Javanmardi  had the necessary skills and experience to give  Mr. Matern the injection. She said Ms. Javanmardi followed proper safety  procedures. She bought her nutrients from a respected pharmacy. She chose proper  nutrients for the injection. She also said that a reasonable person in Ms.  Javanmardi’s position wouldn’t have thought that the injection would hurt Mr.  Matern. She said Ms. Javanmardi’s actions weren’t a “marked departure” (very  different) from what a reasonable person with her skills and training would  have done. The Court of Appeal disagreed. It found Ms. Javanmardi guilty of unlawful  act manslaughter, but said there should be a new trial on criminal negligence. The  majority at the Supreme Court said the trial judge’s ruling should stand. This  meant Ms. Javanmardi was not guilty of both crimes. It is the trial judge’s job  to weigh the evidence and make conclusions about the facts. The majority said  the Court of Appeal was wrong to re-weigh the evidence and replace the trial  judge’s factual conclusions with its own. The majority noted the trial judge was  right to consider Ms. Javanmardi’s extensive training and experience as a  naturopath when deciding what was reasonable in the circumstances.  This  case  came   to  the  Supreme   Court  as  an   appeal  “as  of   right.”  That means there is an  automatic right to appeal. The person doesn’t need the Court’s permission. The  right is automatic in criminal cases when a Court of Appeal replaces a  not-guilty verdict with a guilty verdict, as happened here."
2019 SCC 51,"<strong>Judges don’t have to make someone pay a fine equal to the earnings from  crime they used (with permission) to pay for their defence, the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>
   People  shouldn’t profit from crimes. Property someone gets through crime is called  “proceeds of crime.” The <em>Criminal Code</em> says the Crown (the prosecution) can take the property if it is probably proceeds  of crime. The property is held during the owner’s trial. If the person is found  not guilty, and the property is not proven to be proceeds of crime, they can  have it back. If they are found guilty, the Crown can keep it if a judge says  so. Without  the seized property, a person accused of crimes may not be able to afford a  lawyer to defend them. The <em>Criminal Code </em>says  they can ask a judge to let some of the property be used to pay legal fees. If  the judge agrees, they can set conditions to make sure the money is only used  to pay for legal fees.<strong></strong>
   If  the person is found guilty, a judge will decide their sentence. The sentencing  judge also has to decide exactly what property came from crime. The Crown  usually gets to keep this. If the amount the Crown holds at sentencing is less  than the amount the judge decides came from crime, the judge can make the  person pay a fine. This is to prevent people from spending or hiding the  proceeds of crime before they can be taken permanently. If the person doesn’t  pay, they can go to prison (or go to prison longer). Mr.  Rafilovich was arrested for dealing drugs. The police found almost $50,000 worth of cocaine  and $42,000 in cash. The Crown seized the cash as it was probably proceeds of  crime. In 2009, before his trial, Mr. Rafilovich asked to use the money to pay  for his lawyer. The judge said yes, and set a number of conditions, including an  hourly rate and the maximum number of hours the lawyer could bill. Mr. Rafilovich pleaded  guilty and was sentenced to jail. The judge decided the money the police found  was proceeds of crime. But the money was gone because it had all been used to  pay Mr. Rafilovich’s lawyer. The Crown said Mr. Rafilovich should still have to  pay the total amount as a fine. But the sentencing judge said no. He only used  the money to hire a lawyer, which he wouldn’t have been able to do if the money  wasn’t returned.  The Court of Appeal  said the sentencing judge had to charge the fine. It said paying for a lawyer  with proceeds of crime let Mr. Rafilovich benefit from his crime. The point of  seizing proceeds of crime was to prevent people from benefiting from crime. It fined  Mr. Rafilovich almost $42,000. In the past, lower  courts disagreed about what to do in this kind of situation. The Supreme Court  had to decide what to do when an accused person got a judge’s permission to use  possible proceeds of crime for legal fees. The majority said judges can decide whether or not to charge  a fine, depending on the situation. The sentencing judge was allowed to decide <em>not</em> to fine Mr. Rafilovich.      The majority said that sentencing judges shouldn’t normally  fine someone to get back the amount that was used (with a judge’s approval) to  pay for their legal defence. This would be unfair. An accused person is presumed  to be innocent during their trial. (The presumption of innocence is part of the  reason the <em>Criminal Code</em> says the  money can be returned if a judge gives permission.) If the accused person had  to pay the amount they spent on legal fees to the Crown if they lost, they  might decide not to hire a lawyer. The majority said the purpose of the fine  was to prevent people from spending or hiding the proceeds of crime. It wasn’t  to punish someone from relying on the presumption of innocence and hiring a  lawyer to defend themselves. Criminal justice is meant to provide a fair  process to get a just result. It isn’t about getting maximum punishment at any  cost. This case was about how a judge should use their “discretion.”  Discretion is a judge’s freedom to decide certain issues. That freedom has  limits set by the law. This was the first time the court looked at a judge’s  discretion to order a fine to get back proceeds of crime used to pay legal  fees. "
2019 SCC 50,"<strong>If a  Quebecker is found dead within seven years of going missing, it can  retroactively affect payments that were based on them being alive, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>
     Mr. Roseme was a professor. When he retired, he chose  a pension plan that would pay more each month. The compromise was that the  payments would stop when he died. In September 2007, Mr. Roseme was 77 years old. He was  in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. He went for a walk near his home  and never came back. About a year later, his former employer, Carleton  University, heard Mr. Roseme was missing. Carleton said he must be dead. This  meant it didn’t have to keep paying the pension. It said his former partner,  Ms. Threlfall, had to pay back most of the benefits received since he  disappeared. But Ms. Threlfall pointed out that, under Quebec law,  Mr. Roseme was an “absentee.” An absentee is a person who lives in Quebec and  disappears. No one knows if they are still alive. The law presumes them to be  alive for seven years, unless there is proof of death before then. The law  treats the absentee as if they are alive. They have the same rights (for  example, to pension payments) and duties (for example, to pay their mortgage)  as anyone else. Another person takes over the practical issues for them. If no  proof of death is ever found, the date of death is officially set as the  seventh anniversary of the disappearance.  At this point, Mr. Roseme was an absentee. There was  no proof he was dead. That meant Carleton had to keep paying and Ms. Threlfall  had to manage the payments on his behalf. About six years after he  disappeared, Mr. Roseme’s body was found. The coroner’s report said his death  was likely natural or accidental. His date of death was recorded as September  11, 2007—one day after he disappeared. Since Mr. Roseme went missing, Carleton had paid  almost half a million dollars in pension benefits. Once his death was official,  it asked Ms. Threlfall for the money back. It said Mr. Roseme had agreed the  payments would stop when he died, and he died in 2007. For different reasons, the lower courts both said Ms.  Threlfall had to pay Carleton back.  The Supreme Court majority agreed that Ms. Threlfall  had to pay the money back. It said Mr. Roseme had agreed the pension payments  would stop when he died. This meant when he actually died, not the later date  his death was discovered.  Quebec law presumed Mr. Roseme was alive for the six  years he was missing. But when his body was found, this proved that he wasn’t.  Mr. Roseme had a right to his pension payment while he was alive. This  continued when he went missing but was legally presumed alive. But the majority  said the source of Mr. Roseme’s right to the pension went away when he died,  even if no one knew about it until later. It said that, during the time the  person was <em>presumed</em> to be alive, if  proof was found that they were <em>actually </em>dead,  the law had to rely on the true state of affairs. The majority said this  applied retroactively. This was because of the law about  absentees, and what it is meant to do. Presuming the person is alive protects  their personal and financial interests in the hope that they return. It keeps  things stable, but uncertain. After seven years, the law and the people close  to the absentee need certainty. The death then becomes legally final. If death  is proved within the seven-year period, though, the situation is different.  That’s because the purposes of treating the person as alive no longer apply.  There is no more uncertainty, and no interests to protect for the person’s  return.  Mr. Roseme didn’t have a right to  the pension after he died. The legal basis for Carleton to pay it was the  presumption that he was alive. But this basis fell away once his true date of  death was discovered (even though no one knew that at the time). That meant Ms.  Threlfall had to pay back the money she received on Mr. Roseme’s behalf. Absentees used to be  treated differently in Quebec law. They weren’t considered either alive or  dead. They were declared legally dead once they had been missing for 30 years  or on their 100th birthday. The law was changed with Quebec’s new <em>Civil Code</em> in 1994."
2019 SCC 49,"<strong>A Quebec court doesn’t always have to put its proceedings on hold when a  foreign court is hearing the same dispute, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   In  today’s world, life crosses borders. But laws and courts are local. “Private  international law” is the branch of law that deals with this. For example, a  court may decide not to hear a case if another country has a stronger  connection to it. A court in one country may even apply the laws of <em>another</em> country. Two  people met in France and got married in Belgium. They later moved to Quebec  with their children. In 2014, the husband filed for divorce in Belgium. Three  days later, the wife filed for divorce in Quebec. The husband later said he was  taking back all the gifts he ever gave the wife. Belgian law said he could do  this. The gifts totalled over $33 million and included half of the family’s  home in Quebec.  The  husband asked the Quebec court to “stay” the wife’s application (that is, to  put it on hold). This was because courts in two countries would be deciding the  same dispute, and could make contradictory decisions. This is one of the  problems private international law tries to avoid. The wife also asked the  Belgian court to put the husband’s case on hold. She said the Belgian law letting  him take back the gifts was unconstitutional. There  are three conditions to meet before Quebec courts can consider putting  proceedings on hold to wait for a decision in another country. First, someone  must have asked for a court hearing in the other country first. Second, cases  in both countries have to deal with the same legal dispute. Third, it has to be  possible for the (eventual) foreign decision to be recognized in Quebec. If one  of these conditions isn’t met, the Quebec court can’t order a stay. Even if all  three conditions are met, the Quebec court still has the “discretion” not to  order a stay. Discretion is a judge’s freedom to decide certain issues. But there  are limits to that freedom. The application judge in Quebec said  the third condition wasn’t met. She said Quebec courts wouldn’t recognize a Belgian  decision taking back the gifts. This was because the law unfairly discriminated  against spouses. That meant the case had to go forward in Quebec. Even if all  the conditions were met, the application judge said she still wouldn’t have used  her discretion to put the Quebec proceedings on hold.  The  Court of Appeal said all the conditions were met. It said the third condition  was met if it was <em>possible </em>that the Belgian  decision might be recognized in Quebec. It said the proceedings on divorce and  division of property had to be put on hold in Quebec. (Other issues related to  the children and support could go ahead.) It also said that the application  judge made serious mistakes in using her discretion. In the meantime, the Belgian  courts said <em>they</em> should decide most  of the issues.  The Supreme Court majority agreed  with the Court of Appeal that the husband met all three conditions for a possible  stay. It said even though it wasn’t clear if the Belgian decision would be  recognized in Quebec, the husband had done enough to show it might be.  But the majority said the  application judge’s decision to hear the case should still stand. Even  if the three conditions are met, Quebec courts shouldn’t automatically put  their proceedings on hold. A judge can still decide it’s appropriate to hear a  dispute in Quebec. This could be, for example, if Quebec was closely connected  to the dispute. In this case, the family home (worth over six million dollars)  was in Quebec. A Quebec decision would have some force even if Belgium didn’t  recognize it. The majority added even  if it might not agree with the application judge’s whole analysis, the Court of  Appeal shouldn’t have interfered. For issues where discretion can be used, the  first judge to hear the facts is best-placed to decide. Higher courts can only  interfere if the first judge made a serious legal or factual mistake. It can’t  just be a difference of opinion. The majority said the application judge didn’t  make such a mistake in this case.  The Supreme Court  previously dealt with private international law in <em><a href=""37594-eng.aspx"">Barer v.  Knight Brothers LLC</a></em> and <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/37202-eng.aspx"">Haaretz.com v.  Goldhar</a></em>."
2019 SCC 47,"<strong>A convicted person has the right to the punishment that applied either  when they committed their crime or when they are sentenced, whichever is lower,  the Supreme Court has ruled. They don’t have a right to the lowest punishment  that might have existed any time in between.</strong>
   Everyone  charged with a crime has certain rights. These rights are found in the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  part of Canada’s Constitution. Section 11(i) sets out what happens when the  punishment for a crime changes between the time a person commits the crime and  the time they are sentenced for it. It says the person has the right “to the  benefit of the lesser punishment” in that case. Mr.  Poulin committed sexual crimes between 1979 and 1987. He was charged in 2014,  convicted in 2016, and sentenced in 2017. He was old and in poor health, so he  asked for a conditional sentence. A conditional sentence meant Mr. Poulin  wouldn’t go to jail, but had to follow certain conditions. The sentencing judge  agreed.  The  Crown said the judge was wrong to give Mr. Poulin the conditional sentence. It  said this wasn’t an option either when Mr. Poulin committed his crimes, or when  he was sentenced. It said that the judge could only look at those two points in  time when deciding on the “lesser” punishment. Mr.  Poulin said section 11(i) meant the judge had to look at those two points in  time. But he said the judge also had to look at all the points in time between.  He said he should have the benefit of the lowest punishment that was available for  his crimes at <em>any time</em> over those three  decades. There was a period of time when the law made a conditional sentence an  option for his crimes. He said section 11(i)’s guarantee of the “lesser  punishment” meant he should be able to get it. Most  courts in Canada had followed Mr. Poulin’s interpretation in the past. The  Court of Appeal also agreed. The  majority of the Supreme Court said Mr. Poulin’s interpretation of section 11(i)  was wrong. It said the sentencing judge should only look at the time the crime  was committed and the time Mr. Poulin was sentenced when deciding the lesser  punishment. The  majority said rights should be interpreted generously – but only within the  limits set out by their purposes. Looking at the purposes of section 11(i), the  majority said only two points in time were really relevant to section 11(i).  The first was the time the crime was committed. The punishment in force at this  time reflected the legal risk the person took in choosing to commit the crime.  The second was the time the person is sentenced. The punishment in force at  this time reflects society’s most up-to-date view on what is appropriate. The  majority said section 11(i) wasn’t meant to give a person the right to comb  through the past to find the most favourable punishment ever available. Section  11(i) protects people against the unfairness of being sentenced to a punishment  that society no longer thinks is appropriate for their crimes. But it would be  unfair to make lower punishments available to people who got away with their  crimes longer. This is often the case with sexual crimes like Mr. Poulin’s.  Longer time periods would mean more chance that punishments might change, even  through error or oversight. Offenders like Mr. Poulin would benefit from a  punishment that had little connection either to their criminal behaviour or to  society’s view of the crimes when they were sentenced. Section 11(i) clearly  wasn’t meant to work like that. The  majority noted there could be a situation where the punishment changes between  the time a person is charged and the time they are sentenced. It could be  unfair to give them a harsher punishment that became law later if they relied  on the lower one and turned themselves in. But the majority said this would  have to be decided in a future case. The issue was moot before the  Supreme Court heard it. “Moot” means a judge’s decision doesn’t matter for the  immediate purpose of the parties. This was because Mr. Poulin died shortly  before the Supreme Court heard the case. The Court decided to hear it anyway  because the issue was important and it might affect others. "
2019 SCC 45,"<strong>Police can’t arrest someone who isn’t breaking the law to prevent others  from breaching the peace, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Mr.  Fleming was on his way to join a protest in Caledonia, Ontario in 2009. The  protest was against the occupation of a piece of land by a First Nations group.  He was carrying a Canadian flag on a wooden pole and walking down a street  beside the occupied land.  Police  officers saw him as they drove by. There had been violence in the past, and  they were planning to keep the groups apart. The officers turned their vehicles  around and sped toward him. Mr. Fleming got off the road and crossed a low  fence. He said he did this to get away from the speeding vehicles and onto  level ground. The officers were yelling. Mr. Fleming said he didn’t think they  were yelling at him because he hadn’t done anything wrong. The  people occupying the land came toward him. When they were about ten or twenty  feet away, the police told Mr. Fleming he was under arrest. They ordered him to  drop his flag. He refused. Officers forced him to the ground, took his flag, and  handcuffed him. Mr. Fleming said they injured his arm. The police took him to  jail but let him go a few hours later. He was charged with obstructing a police  officer (preventing a police officer from doing their job). He went to court a  dozen times to fight the charge, which was later dropped. In  2011, Mr. Fleming sued the Province of Ontario and the officers involved in his  arrest. He said the officers acted wrongfully. He said they assaulted and  battered him, wrongfully arrested him, and falsely imprisoned him. He also said  they violated several of his rights under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, part of Canada’s  Constitution. Police  officers get their powers from statutes (like the <em>Criminal Code</em>) and common law (the law made by judges deciding  cases). They can only act within those laws. Under the common law, the police  can limit someone’s freedom (for example, arrest them) if it’s reasonably  necessary to carry out their duties. The police argued they had the power to  arrest Mr. Fleming under the common law. They said it was to prevent a “breach  of the peace.” A breach of the peace is more than a disturbance. It means there  is a risk of violence and that someone will get hurt. The  trial judge said the police didn’t have the power to arrest Mr. Fleming. She  said he should be compensated because officers violated his rights. The  majority at the Court of Appeal disagreed. It said the police <em>did </em>have the power to arrest him. It  said arresting him was necessary because officers thought there was going to be  a breach of the peace. It did say there should be a new trial about whether the  officers used too much force, though. The  Supreme Court unanimously said the officers didn’t have the power to arrest Mr.  Fleming. The police can’t arrest someone acting lawfully just because they  think it will stop others from breaching the peace. They already have other  powers to deal with these situations under the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Since they had these less drastic options, arresting  Mr. Fleming wasn’t really necessary. The  Court noted that preserving the peace, preventing crime, and protecting life  and property are the main duties of police officers under the common law. They  have the power to take actions to support these duties, even if these actions  aren’t specifically set out in the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.Preventing breaches of the  peace is obviously related to preserving the peace, preventing crime, and  protecting life and property. But the Court said it wasn’t reasonably necessary  to arrest someone to prevent a breach of the peace, if that person hadn’t done  (and wasn’t about to do) anything wrong.  Police  are allowed to use as much force as reasonably necessary to carry out their  duties. But in this case, they weren’t allowed to arrest Mr. Fleming, so no  amount of force was justified.  Taking away  someone’s freedom, even temporarily, is serious. Often, in situations like Mr.  Fleming’s, the person wouldn’t have any way to challenge their arrest in court,  because there wouldn’t be any charges. The only option would be an expensive  civil lawsuit. This was another reason the Court said the standards for judging  police actions should be strict."
2019 SCC 44,"<strong>A journalist can only be forced to reveal a source if  it’s absolutely necessary and in the public interest, the Supreme Court has said.</strong>
     Mr. Côté was a former Quebec politician. In 2016, he  was arrested on charges related to possible political corruption from 2000 to  2012. Ms. Denis was a journalist with Radio-Canada. Between  2012 and 2016, she gave four television reports about the possible corruption.  The reports contained sensitive information that Ms. Denis got from  confidential sources. Mr. Côté said the criminal charges  were an “abuse of process” (a misuse of the courts). He asked for a “stay of  proceedings” (a suspension of the charges that is usually permanent). He said  that if he knew who Ms. Denis’ sources were, he could identify who was  responsible for the leaks. He could then prove that the government was trying  to hurt his case, which would justify staying the charges. Mr. Côté got a legal  order to make Ms. Denis reveal her sources. Ms. Denis refused. She said she didn’t even know the  identities of the people who gave her information for two of the reports. The Court of Quebec judge said Ms. Denis didn’t have  to reveal her sources, because she didn’t know who they were. The Superior  Court said the Court of Quebec judge made a mistake. This was because Ms. Denis <em>did</em> know the sources for two of the  four reports. It said she had to provide that information. When Ms. Denis  appealed, the Court of Appeal said it didn’t have the power to decide the issue.  This was because the law said only the first decision (the Court of Quebec’s)  could be appealed, which already happened at the Superior Court. The Court of  Appeal said she could ask for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court,  though. The Supreme Court had to look at two appeals from  Ms. Denis. The first was about whether the Court of Appeal was right to decide  it didn’t have the power to look at her appeal. The second was what should  actually happen with it. The Supreme Court hearing was postponed once because  the Crown (the prosecution) had new evidence and wanted to change its  arguments. The Court didn’t postpone a second time when the Crown asked. The majority at the Supreme Court agreed that the Court  of Appeal didn’t have the power to decide Ms. Denis’ appeal. However, it said the  original court (the Court of Quebec) should look at the whole issue again. The majority said people only have a right to  appeal if a written law says so. In this case, no law said an appeal to a  second court was allowed for an issue like Ms. Denis’. (That is, one that  didn’t decide whether someone was guilty of something, or involve putting them  in jail.) This made sense, because having one level of appeal helps cases move  more quickly. The majority didn’t decide whether Ms. Denis had to  reveal her sources. It said the Court of Quebec should look at everything  again. This was because the Crown had new evidence and wanted to change its arguments.  An appeal court is supposed to decide if a lower court decision should stand.  That means looking at whether the lower court made the right decision, based on  the facts and arguments before it. It can’t do that if suddenly there are new  facts and arguments. That’s one reason why parties normally can’t introduce new  facts and arguments on appeal. (Another reason is that it’s unfair to the other  side.)  This was the first time the Court looked at new rules to  protect journalists’ confidential sources. The majority gave some guidance on  how the rules should be used. It said the person who didn’t want to reveal a  source has to show they are a “journalist” and their source is a “journalistic  source” under the <em>Canada Evidence Act</em>.  The person who wants the information has to show they can’t really get it any  other way. They also have to show that the public has a greater interest in  making sure the crime is prosecuted than it does in protecting the confidential  source. The majority said that revealing journalists’ confidential sources  should only be a last resort. The Court previously  looked at journalists’ confidential sources in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/37574-eng.aspx"">R. v. Vice Media  Canada Inc.</a></em> That case fell under the old rules."
2019 SCC 43,"<strong>Ontario has copyright in plans of survey filed in the province’s land  registry, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
     Copyright protects original works of writing, theatre, music, or art. A  person who has copyright in something has the exclusive right to produce, copy,  publish, or perform it. Canadian copyright law tries to balance two goals. The  first is to reward the people who create new works. The second is to make sure  that the public has access to new ideas and works. There are special rules in the <em>Copyright  Act </em>for when the Crown can own copyright. (“The Crown” is a legal term that  basically means “the government.”) Section 12 of the <em>Copyright Act</em>, which is over a century old,says the Crown has copyright in what it prepares (creates) or  publishes. It also says the government has copyright where it directs or  controls what someone <em>else</em> prepares  or publishes. Ontario has an electronic land registry system. The land registry is a  database about all properties in the province. It says who owns (or has other  rights to) each one. The database contains many kinds of documents,  including plans of survey. Plans of survey show information about a  specific property (like its size and shape), like an official map of the  property. Even though the land registry is electronic, plans of survey still  have to be physically brought to a land registry office to be scanned.  The  electronic land registry system is run by a company called Teranet, which  helped create it. Teranet paid independent surveyors to help build the database  and provide plans of survey. A regulation says that all plans added to the land  registry become property of the Crown (that is, of the Ontario government). Surveyors  bring plans of survey to the land registry office to be included. When they do,  Teranet makes copies of the plans available electronically. Teranet does all of  this on Ontario’s behalf. Keatley Surveying, a land survey company, launched a class action in  2007. A class action is a special kind of lawsuit when a group of people  with the same kind of problem get together to sue. The class action was  on behalf of land surveyors who provided plans of survey to the land registry. It  said the surveyors (not the Crown) had copyright in the plans of survey they  had created. It said Teranet was therefore infringing the land surveyors’  copyright by storing and copying plans of survey. It said  the Crown should only get copyright in works that it created itself (or where  it ordered or controlled creation by someone else). Teranet argued that the  Crown should get copyright in everything it published. In 2016, a judge said  Ontario owned the copyright and said Keatley Surveying’s class action couldn’t  go forward. The Court of Appeal agreed. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Ontario owned the copyright in the  plans of survey.  The  majority said the plans of survey were in a narrow category of documents that  fell under Crown copyright. Crown copyright protects the public interest by  giving the Crown copyright in things whose creation or publication it very much  directed or controlled. This case was about publication, not creation, since  the Crown didn’t create the plans of survey itself. A number of laws set out how  the land registry system worked, the requirements for plans of survey, and how  Ontario could use the plans. The government directed and controlled every  aspect of the publication of the plans of survey. The laws also gave Ontario  the exclusive right to make changes to them, and make them available to the  public. This amount of control meant the Crown owned the copyright, and could  allow Teranet to make copies of the plans of survey on the government’s behalf.  There have been many changes in Canada’s approach to copyright law in the last  hundred years, and the majority took them into account when interpreting section  12.  Section 12 of the <em>Copyright  Act</em>, which deals with Crown copyright, is over a century old. This is the  first time the Supreme Court has looked at this section."
error:https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/cb/2019/38332-p-eng.aspx,"<strong>This case is about language education rights for French speakers in  British Columbia. The Supreme Court has to decide what school services B.C. must  have for its French-speaking community.</strong>  The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> is part of Canada’s Constitution. Section 23 deals with the right to  minority-language education. This is the right to go to school in French or English  when it’s not the main language of the province or territory you live in. Section  23 covers citizens whose first language is French or English. It also covers  citizens who went to primary school in that language, even if it's not their  first language. It says they have the right to send their children to school in that  language. But it also says there have to be enough children to justify paying  for schooling in that language. The services needed could be different,  depending on the number of children. The  Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique is B.C.’s  French-language school board. It said the province had to do more for  French-language education throughout the province. It wanted B.C. to give more  money to French-language schools and fix school buildings and property. It said  B.C. should pay for not spending enough on French-language schools in the past.  The school board said B.C.’s laws and policies breached the French-speaking  community’s language education rights. B.C. said it couldn’t provide all the  services the school board wanted because it would cost too much. It said there weren’t  enough students to justify it. The  trial judge said the province breached the French-speaking community’s rights  under section 23 of the <em>Charter</em> in  several areas of B.C. This was because of the way the province decided how to  fund minority-language education. But she said this didn’t mean the province  had to build new schools and facilities, which would cost over $300 million,  right away. She did say that B.C. should have paid more for school bus  transportation. Not doing so breached section 23. She said the school board  should get $6 million in damages for this.  The  Court of Appeal said courts needed to be practical when looking at section 23.  Giving the school board what it wanted would cost over $300 million. It said  section 23 of the <em>Charter</em> didn’t mean  the province had to provide all the school facilities right away. It also said  the trial judge was wrong to say B.C. had to pay $6 million for transportation.  This was because the policy wasn’t unconstitutional at the time. It was only  found unconstitutional when the trial judge said so. People don’t usually have  to pay for damages caused by laws or policies that are only found  unconstitutional later. The school board appealed. The  Supreme Court will have to decide how courts should deal with minority language  rights under section 23 of the <em>Charter</em>.  This case raises many different issues. One issue is what governments have to  do when there aren’t enough students to justify offering full school services  in the minority language. Another is whether courts should look at costs when  deciding whether a breach of section 23 can be allowed. (Section 1 of the <em>Charter</em> says that certain rights can be  limited, but only if the limit is reasonable and can be justified in a free and  democratic society.)Still another is  whether the province should have to pay damages to the school board in this  situation. This decision could affect many  other minority-language communities across Canada. Many organizations applied  to be “interveners” in this case. Interveners are people or groups who get the  court’s permission to give their point of view, even though the case doesn’t  directly affect them. They submit arguments in writing. Some are also allowed  to make short arguments in person at the hearing. They help the judges see  different angles and make a better decision. "
error:https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/cb/2019/38532-p-eng.aspx,"<strong>This case is about the right to a criminal trial in a reasonable time. The  Supreme Court has to decide if the time a judge takes to decide a case should count  when deciding if a trial is taking too long.</strong>
   The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>is  part of Canada’s Constitution. Section 11(b) says that anyone charged with a  crime has the right to a trial in a reasonable time. The right is about  fairness, but it doesn’t just benefit the person charged with the crime. Long  trials cause suffering and frustration for everyone involved. People accused of  crimes don’t know what is going to happen to them in the future. They often  wait in jail while waiting for their trial. Victims and their families are left  waiting for a final decision. The public doesn’t see justice done. The  right to a trial in a reasonable time is important. It is so important that, if  the trial doesn’t happen fast enough, the trial might be stopped and the  charges suspended. This is called a “stay of proceedings,” and it’s usually  permanent. In 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada decided an important appeal, <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16057/index.do"">R. v.  Jordan</a></em>. It set out rules to decide how long is too long for a  criminal case. It said certain charges should normally be dealt with within 18  months. Other charges should normally be decided within 30 months. Anything  longer would be unfair, unless there was something unusual to justify it. A  trial that takes too long will be stopped, and the charges will be “stayed.”  That means there will be no verdict of not guilty or guilty. No one wants to  see people accused of crimes go free without a trial. But it is crucial to our  democracy that people can get justice in a reasonable time. K.G.K.  was charged with sexual interference (touching someone under 16 in a sexual  way). He was also charged with invitation to sexual touching (asking someone  under 16 to touch someone else in a sexual way). These charges should have been  decided within 30 months. The day before the judge found him guilty, K.G.K.  asked for the trial to be stopped. He said it had taken too long. It had taken over  42 months from the time police charged him to the judge’s decision. It took the  judge nine months to decide the case and give the decision. K.G.K. said this  was longer than the 30-month maximum, and there was nothing unusual in his case  that could justify it. The Crown (the prosecution) argued that the time taken  was justified. It said the judge’s decision-making time didn’t count toward the  time limit. The  motions judge said the trial didn’t take too long. A majority of the Court of  Appeal agreed, but one judge dissented (disagreed). She said the decision-making  time should count, so the trial was unfair and K.G.K. should go free. K.G.K.  appealed. The  Supreme Court needs to give permission to hear appeals in most cases. One  exception is when a Court of Appeal judge dissents on a legal issue in a  criminal case. That’s what happened in this case, so K.G.K. had a right to  appeal without permission. This is called an appeal “as of right.”  Appeals as of right exist so the Court can clarify where there may be confusion  about the law. The  Supreme Court will have to decide if the time a judge takes to make and write a  decision should count when deciding if a trial is taking too long. During the  hearing, the judges will listen to arguments from each side and ask questions.  The judges could decide right away, or give their decision in writing later. This case has a “publication  ban.” A publication ban means no one is allowed to publish certain things.  “Publication” includes posting information online, like on a personal social  media profile. In this case, no one can publish <em>anything</em> that might reveal who any complainants or witnesses are. The  courts used K.G.K.’s initials because saying who he is could indirectly reveal the  identities of other people involved in the case. The punishment for breaking  the publication ban could be jail, a fine, or both. Publication bans are often  used in sexual assault cases and cases involving young people, like this one.  People can publish things about the case, as long as they don’t reveal  identities of people protected by the ban. They can also still watch the  hearing and talk about it."
2019 SCC 42,"<strong>When companies fix prices, even people who bought from other companies can sue them, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>“Optical  disc drives” include CD, DVD, and Blu-ray drives. Pioneer, Toshiba, and other  companies made and sold these drives. They also made other products that  contained them. Mr.  Godfrey said these companies agreed to sell these drives and products at higher  prices. This is called “price fixing.” It is illegal under the federal <em>Competition Act</em>. He said that between  2004 and 2010, consumers paid higher prices because of this. He said the real  market price would have been lower. Mr. Godfrey launched a “class action” in British  Columbia. A class action is a special  kind of lawsuit when a group of people with the same kind of problem get  together to sue. In the phrase “class action,” the “class” is the group and the  “action” is the lawsuit. Class actions can affect many people and their legal  rights. People can be affected even if they don’t actively take part in the  lawsuit. A judge has to give permission for a class action to go ahead. A  “representative plaintiff” stands in for the group. Mr. Godfrey was the  representative plaintiff in this case.  Mr. Godfrey said the “class” should include everyone in B.C. who bought  Pioneer and Toshiba drives. He also said it should include people who bought  drives made and sold by other companies. He said those companies charged higher  prices because Pioneer and Toshiba did. The federal Competition Act said a lawsuit like Mr.  Godfrey’s had to be launched within two years. Pioneer said the claim against  it was too late. This was because the period Mr. Godfrey was suing for ended in  2010 and the class action against Pioneer was launched in 2013. Pioneer and  Toshiba also said they weren’t responsible for what other companies did. They  said the class couldn’t include people who bought products made and sold by  others. The certification judge gave Mr. Godfrey permission to  go ahead with the class action. The Court of Appeal agreed. The majority at the Supreme Court of Canada also said  the class action could go ahead. It said consumers who bought from other  companies besides Pioneer and Toshiba could be part of the class. That’s  because Mr. Godfrey planned to show that Pioneer’s and Toshiba’s actions  affected the entire market. Since Pioneer’s and Toshiba’s prices were higher,  other companies also charged higher prices. People were harmed because they  paid more than they should have. Pioneer and Toshiba made more money as a  result. To get any kind of compensation, though, people who bought from other  companies would have to specifically show that they were harmed.  The  majority also said the two-year deadline to file a lawsuit could be extended if  the person couldn’t really have known about the problem before. It didn’t  actually decide whether Mr. Godfrey was too late to sue Pioneer. It said the  trial judge would have to decide this later. The majority said these kinds of  deadlines have three purposes. The first is to give people certainty, so they  won’t be surprised by lawsuits for things they did long ago. The second is to  make sure the evidence is still available and usable. The third is to encourage  people to take action quickly when they are harmed. In this case, Mr. Godfrey  said Pioneer and Toshiba hid what they were doing so he and the other consumers  couldn’t find out. The majority said it wouldn’t make sense that people could  lose the right to sue before they had any way of even finding out they were  harmed. The  majority also said Mr. Godfrey and the class could sue Pioneer and Toshiba for  two legal reasons. First, they could sue based on the <em>Competition Act</em>, because it said price-fixing was illegal. Second,  they could sue based on rules in the common law (law based on court cases, made  by judges). Different rules applied to each one, and they didn’t exclude each  other. This case didn’t  decide whether Pioneer and Toshiba did anything wrong. It only decided that the  class action could go forward and both sides could present their case. The  Supreme Court of Canada recently dealt with class actions in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37722-eng.aspx"">TELUS  Communications Inc. v. Wellman</a></em> and <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37855-eng.aspx"">L’Oratoire  Saint Joseph du Mont Royal v. J.J.</a></em>"
2019 SCC 41,"<strong>A defendant should have been allowed to ask limited questions about a  complainant’s sexual history, but in this case it wouldn’t have changed the  verdict, the Supreme Court has ruled. </strong> A  fifteen year-old girl was camping with her family one Canada Day weekend. She  said her 20 year-old cousin, R.V., sexually assaulted her. She didn’t tell  anyone at the time, but later found out she was pregnant. Her doctor said she  became pregnant around the end of June or early July. The girl ended the  pregnancy so there was no DNA evidence available to prove who got her  pregnant. R.V. was later charged with sexual assault and sexual interference  (touching someone under 16 in a sexual way).  At R.V.’s trial, the Crown (the prosecution) said the girl was a  virgin before that weekend. It said she became pregnant around the time she  said she was assaulted. It used this evidence to support the charge that R.V.  sexually assaulted her. But R.V. denied this. He said someone else must have  made her pregnant. He wanted to ask the girl whether she had sex with anyone else.  A person who accuses someone else of a  crime (like the girl in this case) is a “complainant.” In sexual assault  cases, there are rules in the <em>Criminal  Code </em>about what anyone can say about a complainant’s sexual  history. Trials are supposed to get to the truth. But some people believe myths  and stereotypes about women and their sexual history. These get in the way of  the truth. The rules are there to protect the trial process, and help judges  and juries get to the truth. Evidence about a complainant’s sexual history will  only be allowed if it meets very strict conditions. In this case, the Crown introduced the evidence about the girl’s  virginity and pregnancy. R.V. wanted to challenge it. He wanted to ask questions  about whether someone else could have made her pregnant. He said if he wasn’t  allowed to challenge what she said, he wouldn’t be able to defend himself  properly.  R.V. had to ask a judge whether he was allowed to ask these questions,  because they were about sexual history. The judge said R.V. was allowed to ask whether  the girl  was telling the truth about being a virgin at the time, and what she thought  “virginity” meant. But he wasn’t allowed to ask whether anyone else could have made  her pregnant.  The trial judge found R.V. guilty and sentenced him to four years in prison.  The Court of Appeal said it was unfair that the Crown could rely on the  pregnancy but R.V. wasn’t allowed to challenge the suggestion that he caused  it. It ordered a new trial. The majority at the Supreme Court agreed that R.V. should have been allowed  to ask the girl whether someone else could have made her pregnant. But it  said it wouldn’t have made a difference. He still would have been found guilty.  It said the guilty verdict should stand. The majority said that the presumption of innocence is vital to our criminal  law. Part of the presumption of innocence is being able to defend yourself.  That meant R.V. had to be able to challenge the evidence against him by asking  questions. While the pregnancy was evidence that some kind of sexual activity  had happened, it wasn’t evidence of who caused the pregnancy or when. These  questions were important to getting to the truth. But the Court noted that the  questions would have been limited, under the <em>Criminal Code </em>rules, to protect the girl’s  dignity and privacy. The majority said that in rare cases like this one, even  if R.V. had been allowed to ask his questions differently, it wouldn’t have  changed the result. During R.V.’s trial, the girl said she was a virgin at the time  and there was nothing to suggest she was lying. The majority said a judge should have decided what could be said about  sexual history, and how R.V. could challenge it, even before the Crown  introduced the evidence. The majority noted that judges have to make sure any questions  that are allowed don’t go too far in invading the complainant’s privacy. Judges  can also change rulings about these kinds of questions if things change during  the trial.The Court recently dealt  with a complainant’s sexual history in <em><a href=""38270-eng.aspx"">R. v.

2019 SCC 40,"<strong>Military members charged with civilian crimes don’t have the right to be tried by a jury if they are tried in the  military justice system, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>In  Canada, the military justice system has always been separate from the civilian  justice system. This is because the military has unique needs, like discipline,  efficiency, and morale. The <em>National  Defence Act</em> sets out the rules for the military justice system. It says  that when a military member commits a crime under a federal law (such as the <em>Criminal Code</em>), that is a “service  offence.” Service offences can be tried in the military justice system.  Several  military members were accused of serious crimes, like sexual assault and  forgery. They wanted to be tried by jury. But the military justice system,  unlike the civilian system, has never had juries. Trials can take place before  a judge and a military panel, but a panel isn’t the same as a jury. While a  jury is made up of twelve people from all parts of Canadian society, a military  panel is made up of only five people, all from the military.  The  accused military members argued that the <em>National  Defence Act</em>breached their constitutional right to be tried  by a jury. They said this was guaranteed under section 11(f) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  part of Canada’s Constitution. Section 11(f) says people charged with crimes have  the right to be tried by a jury if they could go to jail for five years or  more. But there is an exception: the right does not apply to crimes under  military law tried before military courts. This is called the “military  exception.” The accused military members argued that this exception applied  only to “pure” military crimes, like spying or mutiny. They said it didn’t  apply to civilian crimes that any Canadian (military member or not) could be  charged with. The military prosecutors, on the other hand, said the exception  applied to <em>all</em> service offences, including  civilian crimes by military members. All but one of the  challenges failed, and appeals followed. In the first  appeal (<em>Stillman</em>), the Court Martial  Appeal Court of Canada (a military court) ruled that they didn’t have a right  to be tried by a jury. But in the second appeal (<em>Beaudry</em>), the same court reached the opposite result. This meant there  were conflicting rulings. The  majority at the Supreme Court said military members could be tried for civilian  crimes without juries. The Constitution gives Parliament power over the  military. This includes the power to pass a law saying that civilian crimes committed  by military members are service offences. This makes them offences under  military law. The majority noted that when a military member commits a civilian  crime (even in a non-military setting), that has an impact on discipline,  efficiency, and morale. Because of all this, the majority concluded that when a  military member is charged with a civilian crime, the military exception under  section 11(f) of the <em>Charter</em> applies.  That means there is no right to be tried by a jury. Juries have been part of the common law system  for  over 900 years. They  are meant to protect the individual from the heavy powers of the state (or, in  older times, the king or queen). They are also meant to inform the public about  the law and how the legal system works, and apply community standards to trial  verdicts. Juries  play an important role in the justice system, but the <em>Charter </em>makes clear that the right to a jury has an exception. "
2019 SCC 39,"<strong>Judges can give bail conditions to people not charged with crimes while  they wait for a peace-bond hearing, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled.</strong>
     Mr.  Penunsi was in prison. A police officer thought he might hurt someone once he  was freed and asked a judge for a “peace bond.” A peace bond is a promise to  the court to keep the peace, behave, and follow certain conditions. It is meant  to prevent crime. Having a peace bond against you is different than being  charged with a crime, but breaking the promise to the court is a crime. The  judge put out an arrest warrant to make Mr. Penunsi come to court to respond to  the request. But he was already in prison, so he wasn’t arrested. A court date  was scheduled for after he would be freed. The Crown (the prosecution) was  afraid he might hurt someone in the meantime. It said Mr. Penunsi should either  have to stay in jail or follow certain conditions until then. It asked for a  bail hearing so a judge could decide what to do. Mr.  Penunsi argued that bail rules didn’t apply to peace bonds. He said bail was  only for people charged with crimes, and he wasn’t being charged with anything.  The provincial court judge agreed that bail rules didn’t apply to peace bonds.  Because of this, he said he didn't have the power to hold a bail hearing.  The Crown asked a superior court judge to review the provincial court  judge’s decision. (The superior court that handles trials in Newfoundland and  Labrador is called the “Supreme Court.”) That judge said bail rules applied to peace  bonds. The Court of Appeal, however, said they didn’t. This was because someone  waiting for a peace-bond hearing isn’t charged with a crime.  The  issue was moot before the superior court judge heard it. “Moot” means the  judge’s decision didn’t matter for practical purposes because the problem was  already solved. Mr. Penunsi had willingly agreed to follow certain  conditions after he left prison. But the issue was important, so the judge  decided to hear the case anyway. Courts in other parts of Canada also couldn’t  agree on what to do in situations like Mr. Penunsi’s. It depended on how  parts of the <em>Criminal Code</em> were  interpreted. The law wasn’t clear. The  Supreme Court of Canada unanimously said that arrest and bail rules applied to  peace bonds. But it said the rules applied in a unique way, so they had to be  modified. This was to make sure they were appropriate for <em>preventing</em> crime, rather than dealing with someone already accused  of one. The Court looked at the text, context, and purpose of parts of the <em>Criminal Code</em> dealing with peace bonds,  arrest, and bail.  The  Court said that judges can get people to appear in court to answer to peace  bonds in two ways. The usual way is by an order to come to court, called a “summons.”  Sometimes, though, an arrest warrant is appropriate. If the person is arrested,  a judge can order a bail hearing. At the bail hearing, the judge can put  conditions on them while they wait for their peace-bond hearing. The conditions  should only deal with making sure the person shows up for court and protecting the  public before the hearing. If the person is not arrested (for example, if they  get a summons), the judge can’t put conditions on them before the peace-bond  hearing.  Mr.  Penunsi wasn’t arrested according to the law. When someone is arrested, they  have to be told why and have a chance to get a lawyer. This didn’t happen for  Mr. Penunsi. Since he wasn’t arrested, the bail rules didn’t apply. That meant  the judge couldn’t put conditions on him before his peace-bond hearing.  The  Court also said judges had to be careful not to set peace-bond defendants up to  fail. Often, judges order people to stay away from drugs and alcohol as a bail condition.  This can be very hard for people with addictions. Like a peace bond, being on  bail is not a crime. But breaking a bail condition is. Judges should be very  careful not to turn people into criminals for something they can’t control. Keeping someone in  jail should be a last resort. When a person isn’t charged with a crime, it  should only happen if they refuse to promise to follow conditions while waiting  for their peace-bond hearing. The Supreme Court of Canada recently dealt with  bail in <em><a href=""37869-eng.aspx"">R. v. Myers</a></em>.

2019 SCC 38,"<strong>A jury shouldn’t have heard that an accused person and a complainant in  a sexual assault case were “friends with benefits,” the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>
   Mr.  Goldfinch dated and lived with a woman for a while. She ended the relationship,  but they later got back in touch. They considered their relationship to be  “friends with benefits.”
   One  evening in 2014, the woman was at Mr. Goldfinch’s place. They had drinks with  Mr. Goldfinch’s roommate. The woman said she told Mr. Goldfinch that sex wasn’t  going to happen that night, but Mr. Goldfinch said he didn’t hear this. They  kissed on the couch, and Mr. Goldfinch said they should go to bed. After that,  their stories became very different. Mr.  Goldfinch said he followed her to his bedroom. He said they each took off their  own clothes, and then had sex. He said he fell asleep and she woke him up  later, saying he hit her on the head in his sleep. He said he was annoyed and  told her to leave.  The  woman said she told Mr. Goldfinch she didn’t want to have sex. She said he  dragged her to the bedroom, and it was like something “just snapped” in him.  She said he pushed her onto the bed, hit her, and forced her to have sex.  Mr. Goldfinch was charged with sexual assault. He  wanted to tell the jury that he and the woman were “friends with benefits”. He  said this was important context for jury members to know. He said if the jury  thought the relationship was not a sexual relationship, he wouldn’t be able to  properly defend himself. He wanted the jury to know specifically that, as  “friends with benefits,” they had sex from time to time. The Crown (the  prosecution) agreed to tell the jury they had dated and lived together and  that, sometimes, the woman would stay the night at his house.  A  person who accuses someone else of a crime (like the woman in this case) is a  “complainant.” In sexual assault cases, there are rules in the <em>Criminal Code </em>about what the defence and  Crown can say about a complainant’s sexual history. Trials are supposed to get  to the truth. But some people believe myths and stereotypes about women and their  sexual history. These get in the way of the truth. One myth is that a person  who agreed to sex in the past is more likely to agree again. Evidence that might  support this myth is not allowed at trial, except where it’s relevant and  useful for <em>other</em> important reasons. The trial judge said Mr. Goldfinch was allowed to tell  the jury that he and the complainant were “friends with benefits” because this  was important “context” to understand their relationship. The jury found him  not guilty. The Crown appealed. The Court of Appeal said the evidence shouldn’t  have been allowed. Just saying the evidence was “context” wasn’t enough to  outweigh the risk that the jury would make its decision based on a myth. (That  is, the myth that because a woman has said yes in the past, she was more likely  to say yes this time.) The  majority at the Supreme Court agreed that the evidence shouldn’t have been  allowed. While Mr.  Goldfinch said the evidence was for “context,” it didn’t add anything useful to  help the jury decide his guilt. In this case, telling the jury he and the woman  had a sexual relationship was only useful for one reason. That was to suggest she  had agreed to have sex in the past, and so was more likely to agree that night,  too. This is wrong because agreeing to sexual acts (consent) doesn’t carry over  from one time to the next.  Consent has to be given, and communicated, at the time of each act. By letting the jury hear the  evidence, the judge made a legal mistake. The judge should  have made Mr. Goldfinch show that the evidence was useful for some other  important reason. The  majority said there should be a new trial where the rules about using the  complainant’s sexual history would be followed. This case came to the Supreme  Court as an appeal “as of right.” That means there is an automatic right to  appeal. The person doesn’t need the Court’s permission. The right is automatic  in criminal cases when a Court of Appeal judge dissents (disagrees) on a point  of law, as happened here. The Court previously dealt with sexual history  evidence in <em><a href=""37769-eng.aspx"">R. v. Barton</a></em>. "
2019 SCC 37,"<strong>Quebec tax officials were allowed to send a letter  demanding information to a bank branch in Alberta, the Supreme Court has  unanimously ruled.</strong>
     Under the Constitution, provinces have the power to  tax on their territories. Whether someone pays tax depends on where they  “reside.” A person’s place of residence is usually where they live. For a trust  (which is a “legal” person), it is usually where the trust is managed. Figuring  out residence can be complicated. Quebec collects its own income taxes, unlike  other provinces. The province’s tax officials can demand information to enforce  tax laws. Anyone who doesn’t agree to provide the information can be fined or  sent to prison. Bitton Trust was set up in Alberta by a Quebec family in  2003. The trust had a bank account with National Bank in Calgary. But Quebec  tax officials thought the trust might actually reside in Quebec. If so, the  trust would have to pay taxes there. In 2014, Quebec tax officials asked for  some information and documents about the trust that would help them figure this  out. They sent a formal demand letter to the branch where the account was (in  Calgary). Quebec tax officials said that this is what a federal law, the <em>Bank Act</em>, said they had to do. The <em>Bank Act </em>said that any demand had to go  to the branch where the account was located.  The trust said that Quebec officials didn’t have the  power to do this. That’s  because under Quebec’s <em>Tax Administration  Act</em>, they had power only in Quebec. It said that any action the tax officials  took outside the province would be “extraterritorial” (outside the place where  they had power). That meant sending the demand letter to the Calgary branch  would be outside their power, even if the <em>Bank  Act </em>required it. The trust asked the Quebec courts to quash (cancel) the  demand. Everyone  agreed that without the federal law, the <em>Bank  Act, </em>the officials could send the demand to National Bank in Quebec. The  issue was whether the Quebec tax officials could send the demand outside Quebec  to the Calgary branch, as the <em>Bank Act </em>required.  The  motions judge said that the tax officials could send the demand to the Calgary  branch, and the Court of Appeal agreed.All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed with  the lower courts. They said that the Quebec tax officials had the power to send  the demand to National Bank’s Calgary branch. This was because National Bank  operated in Quebec. Quebec tax officials had power over anyone operating in the  province’s territory. All the <em>Bank Act</em> did was say how the officials had to communicate their demand to National Bank.  Specifically, it said they had to send their demand directly to the branch where  the account was located. In this case, the branch happened to be in a different  province. But that didn’t change the fact that the Quebec tax officials had  power over National Bank. The tax officials weren’t trying to exercise power in  Alberta just because they sent the demand there. Whatever action they were  going to take against National Bank if it didn’t comply would happen in Quebec.  So the demand wasn’t “extraterritorial.” The tax officials were allowed to  demand the information in the way that they did, and National Bank had to give  it to them, or face the consequences. However, the judges noted it might be  different if National Bank didn’t operate in Quebec. The Supreme Court didn’t decide  where Bitton Trust should pay taxes. It only decided that the Quebec tax officials  could get the information it demanded to decide whether the trust had to pay in  Quebec.

2019 SCC 35,"<strong>A class-action lawsuit against a religious group (and an institution it  ran) for sexual abuse can go forward, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
     JJ said he was sexually abused by both his teacher and a priest in the 1950s.  Both were members of the Congrégation de Sainte-Croix. He said the teacher  abused him at school. He said the priest abused him at the Oratoire  Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal, where JJ was an altar boy.The priest died in  2001 and the teacher died in 2004.  JJ  didn’t tell anyone about the abuse for decades. He said he had nightmares and  flashbacks for years. He believed there were other victims like him, so he  decided to launch a “class action” in Quebec in 2013.  A  class action is a special kind of lawsuit when a group of people with the same kind of  problem get together to sue. In the phrase “class action,” the “class” is the  group and the “action” is the lawsuit. Class actions can affect many people and  their legal rights, even if they aren’t actively involved. A judge has to give  permission for (authorize) a class action to go ahead. The judge is just  supposed to look at whether the class action meets the conditions to go to  court, not whether it will succeed. They have to assume the facts are true unless  they are clearly wrong or unlikely. A “representative plaintiff” represents the  group and asks for permission to launch the class action by applying to the  court. JJ wanted to be the representative plaintiff in this case. JJ said the Congrégation and the Oratoire were directly  responsible for what happened to him by their own acts. He said they knew (or  should have known) about the abuse but didn’t stop it, and even covered it up.  He said they were also responsible for the acts of the teacher and the priest,  because they assigned them to work with children.  The Congrégation and the Oratoire  said the class action shouldn’t be allowed. They said the class members didn’t  have similar issues because the abuse happened in different places. They said JJ  waited too long after the men he said abused him died. They said JJ didn’t show  enough facts that anything happened. The Oratoire said it couldn’t be  responsible just because abuse might have happened on its property. The  judge agreed with the Congrégation and the Oratoire that the class action  couldn’t go forward. But the Court of Appeal disagreed. It unanimously said the  class action against the Congrégation could go forward. The majority said the  class action against the Oratoire could go forward as well. <br/>
     All  the judges of the Supreme Court agreed it wasn’t too late for JJ to sue. They  noted that Quebec had a new three-year time limit to sue if the abuser or  victim died. But most judges said the rule didn’t apply to a lawsuit against third  parties like the Congrégation and the Oratoire. It only applied to lawsuits brought  against the abuser’s succession (estate), or brought by the victim’s succession,  after they died. Just because the men JJ said abused him died didn’t mean he  couldn’t sue the Congrégation and the Oratoire for their own failures to  prevent or stop the abuse. In any case, most judges said the time limit started  when a victim realized that the abuse was responsible for their injury. This  could be long after the abuser died. Most judges noted that the changes to the  law were meant to make it easier for victims of sexual abuse to get justice,  not harder. Most  judges said the class action could go forward against the Congrégation. The  majority said all the class members had a similar issue. They wanted to know whether  the Congrégation was responsible for sexual assaults on children by members  assigned to work with those children. The majority said that just because the  children didn’t report the abuse at the time didn’t mean that the Congrégation  didn’t know what was happening. The  majority said the class action could go forward against the Oratoire as well.  It wasn’t being sued because it was the location of some of the assaults. It  was being sued because of its close connection to the Congrégation, and because  its directors—who were all Congrégation members—failed to stop (or covered up)  the abuse. This case doesn’t  mean that JJ won the class-action lawsuit. It only means that a court can now  hear all the arguments and make a decision."
2019 SCC 34,"<strong>Evidence found on a young racialized man who was detained by police  without reasonable suspicion can’t be used against him in court, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>
   One  evening in 2012, Mr. Le and four friends were hanging out in a backyard  talking. Three police officers saw them. The officers hadn’t been called there  for any specific reason. They didn’t have a warrant. They had just been told  that this was a “problem address” for drug dealing and that a wanted suspect  sometimes hung out there. They didn’t see the men doing anything wrong. Even  so, the officers came into the yard without asking permission. They questioned  the men, told one of them to keep his hands visible, and asked for ID. Mr.  Le said he didn’t have ID with him. The officer asked what was in the bag he  was carrying. At that point, Mr. Le ran away. He was arrested and found to have  a gun, drugs, and cash. He was charged with ten crimes related to these items.  At his trial, Mr. Le said the items found on him  couldn’t be used as evidence against him. He said the police breached his  rights under the <em>Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms</em>. The <em>Charter</em> is part of Canada’s Constitution. Section 9 says that “everyone has the right not  to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.” This means that police can’t detain people,  or put them in jail, without a legal reason. Section 24(2) says that evidence  taken by breaching someone’s rights  can’t be used if it “would bring the administration  of justice into disrepute.” That means it can’t be used if admitting it could make  people lose faith in the justice system and the laws meant to protect them. Everyone  agreed that the police had no legal authority to make Mr. Le and his friends  answer questions, follow directions, or show ID. Everyone agreed that Mr. Le  was detained at some point. The question was exactly when, and whether there  was a legal reason for it. The  trial judge said Mr. Le wasn’t detained until he was asked about his bag. He  said the detention was legal because the officers had reasonable suspicion of a  crime by that point (they thought Mr. Le might have a gun). He found Mr. Le  guilty. A majority of the Court of Appeal agreed.  The  majority at the Supreme Court said the detention was illegal. It said the  police actions were so shocking that the items they found by detaining Mr. Le couldn’t  be used against him in court.  The majority said someone is “detained” when an  ordinary person in the same situation would think that they weren’t free to  leave and had to comply with police demands. Mr. Le was a member of a  racialized community in a low-income area. Members of racial minorities and  people living in low-income areas often have more negative police contacts than  other people do. An ordinary person stopped by the police many times before  would think they had to do what the police said. The majority said Mr. Le was  detained as soon as the officers entered the backyard. The  majority noted that the officers came in without warning and without any reasonable  suspicion of a crime. (Someone just <em>saying</em> that drug dealing was happening wasn’t enough.) Since they didn’t have  reasonable suspicion, what they did was illegal. The majority said this was  exactly the kind of thing the <em>Charter </em>was  meant to protect people from. The  police got the evidence against Mr. Le by walking into a backyard and detaining  him without a legal reason. If this were allowed, the majority said, people  would lose faith in the justice system. Police  have to follow the <em>Charter </em>in all  neighbourhoods and for all people, no matter what their racial background or  income. This helps people trust the law and the police, and makes our  communities safer. The majority said the evidence the police found on Mr. Le couldn’t  be used against him. It entered not-guilty verdicts for the charges. This result  wasn’t because the <em>Charter</em> doesn’t  care about violence, drugs, or community safety. It was because the illegal  police actions were so serious. This case came to  the Supreme Court as an appeal “as of right.” That means there is an automatic  right to appeal. The person doesn’t need the Court’s permission. The right is  automatic in criminal cases when a Court of Appeal judge dissents (disagrees)  on a point of law, as happened here."
2019 SCC 33,"<strong>NOTE:</strong><em>  </em>this document contains details that may be upsetting  to some readers.<strong>A man found not guilty of killing an Indigenous  woman must be re-tried for manslaughter because trial rules for dealing with  sexual history weren’t followed, the Supreme Court has ruled. </strong>
   In  2011, Ms. Gladue bled to death from a wound inside her vagina. Mr. Barton was charged  with first-degree murder, the most serious kind. In this case, it was  considered so serious because the Crown (the prosecution) said Mr. Barton  murdered Ms. Gladue while sexually assaulting her with a weapon. It said he cut  her with a sharp object while she was very drunk, and that he wanted to  seriously harm or kill her.  The  Crown said even if Mr. Barton wasn’t guilty of murder, he was guilty of “unlawful  act manslaughter.” This is when someone causes another person to die while  doing something dangerous and illegal that they should have known might cause serious  harm. Unlawful act manslaughter is “included” in the charge of first-degree  murder. A person can be found guilty of an included offence even if they aren’t  found guilty of the more serious crime.   Mr.  Barton said he hired Ms. Gladue to have sex two nights in a row. On the first  night, he said, he put his hand in her vagina and thrust a few minutes before  having sex. On the second night, he said, he did the same thing, but thrust  deeper and harder. This time, he said, there was blood. He said she went to the  bathroom to clean up, and he fell asleep. He said he found her dead the next  morning.  Mr.  Barton said he didn’t cut Ms. Gladue with a sharp object, and that her death  was an accident. He said she agreed to the thrusting, so there was no sexual  assault—meaning there was no illegal act to turn what happened into first-degree  murder or unlawful act manslaughter. Or, at least, he said he honestly <em>believed</em> she agreed to it. What he  honestly believed was important, because in sexual assault cases a person might  have a defence if they honestly believe the other person agreed to the acts.  The defence has to be based on facts and law. A person can’t rely on a defence  if they get the law wrong.  The  jury found Mr. Barton not guilty. But the Crown said the judge made mistakes,  and there should be a new trial. The Court of Appeal agreed. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that the trial judge made mistakes. The  law says defences to sexual assault can’t rely on things that support myths  about women or sexual consent. That means these myths can’t be used to help  decide if someone agreed to a sexual act (or if the person charged honestly <em>believed </em>they did). The first myth is  that women who have had sex before are more likely to agree to sex. The second  is that such women might not be telling the truth.  These  are myths because they are false. The law puts rules in place to prevent these  myths from affecting jury decisions. But the rules weren’t followed in this  case. Mr. Barton didn’t ask the court for permission to tell the jury about Ms.  Gladue’s sexual history from the first night. The trial judge didn’t decide  which evidence was allowed or tell the jury how that evidence could be used in  its decision. The jury didn’t have the legal instructions it needed. The  mistakes were serious enough that the judges said a new trial should take  place. The  majority said a new trial should only be for unlawful act manslaughter, not  first-degree murder. This was because the trial judge’s mistakes didn’t affect  the murder charge. That charge was based on the argument that Mr. Barton cut  Ms. Gladue with a sharp object. The jury did not believe that happened. The  majority said the jury’s decision on the murder charge should stand. The  majority also said that Mr. Barton had to believe Ms. Gladue <em>communicated</em> that she agreed, not just  that she agreed to the sexual act. This case raised the  issue of myths and prejudices about women, sex workers, and Indigenous people,  like Ms. Gladue. Everyone  has an equal right to dignity and respect. Everyone has the  right to make sexual choices about their own body. It doesn’t matter who they  are, or what their reputation is, or what they’ve done in the past. That’s the  law. If someone else doesn’t respect those choices, it’s a crime."
2019 SCC 31,"<strong>Anyone charged with a provincial offence in BC has the right to a trial  in either English or French (just like for a criminal trial), the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>
     The federal government has the power to make laws on  crimes. These are mostly found in the <em>Criminal  Code</em>, and include things like murder. The <em>Criminal Code </em>also explains the rules for how criminal trials  should take place.  Provinces  and territories have powers to make laws about “quasi-crimes” (which are kind  of like crimes, but usually aren’t as serious). These are called provincial (or  territorial) offences, and include things like not wearing a seatbelt. BC has an <em>Offence Act </em>that explains the rules  for how provincial offences trials should take place. Mr.  Bessette was charged with a provincial offence in BC. He asked for his trial to  be in French. If  he had been charged with a crime under the <em>Criminal  Code</em>, Mr. Bessette would have had the right to have his trial in either English  or French. The right isn’t just about fair trials. It’s about the person’s  linguistic and cultural identity. All courts in Canada that deal with criminal  matters already hold criminal trials in both official languages. This includes  the BC Provincial Court, where Mr. Bessette’s trial was taking place. Mr.  Bessette’s provincial offence wasn’t a crime, so the <em>Criminal Code </em>didn’t apply – at least not directly. But the BC <em>Offence Act </em>didn’t say anything about  trial language. It did say the <em>Criminal  Code</em>could be used to fill in any gaps in the <em>Offence Act</em>. Mr. Bessette said that meant the parts of the <em>Criminal Code</em> that talked about language  applied. He said he should get to choose to have his trial in either French or  English. The Crown (the prosecution)  disagreed. It said trials for provincial offences had to be in English. This  was because an 18th-century English law said so. This law was part  of BC law because BC adopted all the English criminal laws that existed while  it was an English colony. The Provincial Court judge agreed with the Crown. Mr.  Bessette challenged the decision but the higher courts in BC didn’t look at his  arguments. They said he should wait to raise them on appeal if he were found  guilty. There is a general rule  that criminal and quasi-criminal trials shouldn’t be stopped in the middle to  deal with side issues. That’s because it’s important to get trials done  quickly. Mr. Bessette said language rights were too important to be just a side  issue. He said the higher courts in BC should have cancelled the Provincial  Court’s decision to run his trial in English. The Supreme Court of Canada  unanimously agreed that Mr. Bessette had the right to a trial in French. It  said the BC Supreme Court judge was wrong to make him wait to appeal if he were  found guilty. It looked at how the <em>Offence  Act</em>, <em>Criminal Code</em>, and 18th-century  English law worked together. It said that when someone is charged with a  provincial offence, the <em>Offence Act</em> applies first. The only exception is if another, more specialized law has  priority. In this case, the specialized law (the <em>Motor Vehicle Act</em>)didn’t  say anything about trial language. That meant the <em>Offence Act </em>still applied – except it didn’t say anything about  trial language, either. But it did say the <em>Criminal  Code</em> could fill in any gaps. The <em>Criminal  Code</em> said Mr. Bessette could have his trial in either language. The Court  said this overrode the 18th-century English law.  Because  the law said Mr. Bessette had a choice, the Provincial Court didn’t have the  power to make him have his trial in English. Any decision on his case would  have no legal effect because it wouldn’t respect his trial language rights. If  he lost this (English) trial, he could have appealed about the trial language  issue. But he would likely have to go through a second (French) trial once the  appeal court saw the mistake. If he won his (English) trial, he would never  have a chance to have his language rights respected, because you can’t appeal  when you win.This case wasn’t about Mr.  Bessette’s language rights under the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. It was about what all the laws that applied  to his trial, taken together, said about what language he could be tried in. The Supreme Court of  Canada previously dealt with language rights during hearings in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/37642-eng.aspx"">Mazraani v.  Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc.</a></em>

2019 SCC 29,"<strong>Everyone has a right to the strongest protections to make sure they  aren’t held in custody against the law, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Mr. Chhina  came to Canada in 2006 and got refugee status two years later. In 2012, he was  ordered to leave Canada for lying on his refugee application and committing  crimes. He was held in custody for a while, but released with conditions while  he waited for his travel documents. Mr. Chhina disappeared and was only found by  the police a year later. He was then held in maximum security and kept on  lockdown for all but 90 minutes a day.  Mr.  Chhina said that his treatment was illegal under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, part of Canada’s  constitution. He argued that he had been there over a year and no one could  tell him how much longer he would be held. He also said the lockdown conditions  were not appropriate. He applied for <em>habeas  corpus</em> (pronounced “HAY-bee-us KOR-pus”) in 2016.  <em>Habeas corpus</em> is an old and  important legal concept, dating back many centuries. It means “produce the  body” in Latin. Taking someone’s freedom away should be a last resort, and <em>habeas corpus</em> guarantees it won’t happen  illegally. Section 10(c) of the <em>Charter</em> says that “[e]veryone has the  right on arrest or detention… to have the validity of the detention determined  by way of <em>habeas corpus </em>and to be  released if the detention is not lawful.” This means a person can ask a court  to decide if they are being held illegally. If the authorities  can’t show enough of a reason, the court will order them to let the person go. <em>Habeas corpus </em>is so important that  courts have rules to hear these applications quickly and give them priority  over other court business. There are  only two exceptions where a person can’t use <em>habeas corpus</em>. The first is when they try to challenge being found  guilty or challenge their punishment. (They can challenge these by appealing  the decision to a higher court instead.) The second is when there is another  process in place that is as good as, or better than, <em>habeas corpus</em>.  The judge  decided not to hear Mr. Chhina’s application. He said the process under the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</em> was  just as good as <em>habeas corpus</em>, so it  fell under that exception. The Court of Appeal said this wasn’t the case. It  said the judge should have heard Mr. Chhina’s application. Everyone  agreed that the review process under the Act worked in general. The question  was whether it worked as well as <em>habeas  corpus</em> for Mr. Chhina’s specific situation. The majority  at the Supreme Court said that it didn’t. This was for several reasons. One  reason had to do with the kind of review that happened. Decision-makers would  review someone’s detention every 30 days under the Act, but they usually based  their decision on what was decided before. Under <em>habeas corpus</em>, a judge would give the situation a fresh and  independent look. Another reason had to do with the power to change things.  Under the Act, a judge could only look at a specific decision from a  decision-maker. Because of the first reason, the judge was limited to a decision  that was usually based on a previous decision. Under <em>habeas corpus</em>, a judge could look at the whole situation, not just  what the decision-maker looked at. A third reason had to do with what each side  had to show or prove. Under the Act, a detained person had to show why they  should be released. Under <em>habeas corpus</em>,  it was up to the authorities to show why the person should be held. This put  less of a burden on the person to prove their case, so <em>habeas corpus</em> was better for them. A fourth reason was time. The  process under the Act took weeks, and so by the time it got to a judge it was  often too late. <em>Habeas corpus</em> could  happen quickly, and a judge could order the person released right away if they  were being held illegally, which was obviously better for them. The majority said  the judge should have heard Mr. Chhina’s application. This case was “moot” by the time it reached the  Supreme Court, meaning it didn’t matter for practical purposes. This was  because Mr. Chhina had already been deported and wasn’t detained anymore. The  Court decided to hear the case anyway because the issues were so important."
2019 SCC 28,"<strong>The actual relationship—not the words in a contract—will  determine whether someone is an employee, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Modern Cleaning Concept offered  cleaning services. It signed contracts with clients and managed the business,  but hired cleaners (which it called “franchisees”) to do the actual cleaning. Clients  got bills from Modern Cleaning Concept, not from the cleaners. Mr. Bourque had his own  part-time cleaning business in the Quebec City area. His spouse helped him with  cleaning jobs. In 2014, he became one of Modern Cleaning Concept’s cleaners.  The agreement said Mr. Bourque was an independent contractor and had full  control over his business. But it also said Modern Cleaning Concept had a lot  of control over him. Mr. Bourque had to report any complaints right away, and  fire an employee if the company or a client asked. He had to report any new possibilities  for cleaning contracts, so the company could sign the client. Modern Cleaning  Concept paid Mr. Bourque directly, and would deduct amounts he owed under the agreement.  This could be up to 43% of what he earned. After five months, Mr.  Bourque left because he couldn’t build his business or make profits. He ended the  agreement and went back to his own business. In the Quebec City area,  employees cleaning public buildings are covered by a collective agreement. This  is called the <em>Decree respecting building  service employees in the Québec region</em>. “Employee” is defined in the <em>Act respecting collective agreement decrees</em>.  It doesn’t include independent contractors. The <em>Comité paritaire de l’entretien d’édifices publics de la région de  Québec</em> (the Committee) makes sure the Decree is followed.  The Committee looked at Mr.  Bourque’s situation. His agreement with Modern Cleaning Concept said he was an  independent contractor. But the Committee thought he was really an employee. This  would mean the company owed Mr. Bourque and his spouse over $9,000 in unpaid  wages and benefits. It took the claim to court on their behalf. The trial judge said Mr.  Bourque was an independent contractor. But the majority at the Court of Appeal  said he was an employee. It said the trial judge should have thought more about  the company’s business model. It said the way three different parties (Modern  Cleaning Concept, its clients, and Mr. Bourque) were tied together was  important to deciding this case. The majority at the Supreme Court agreed with the  Court of Appeal. It said that to  decide if someone is an independent contractor or an employee really depends on  the specific facts. Independent contractors are more like businesses. They take  on business risks in order to make profits. Employees don’t. Looking at the  contract with the client and the agreement with Mr. Bourque, it was clear that Modern  Cleaning Concept kept the risk and the chance to profit. It was responsible to  its clients for making sure the work got done. It was rewarded for taking this  risk, with up to 43% of Mr. Bourque’s earnings. It controlled him closely with  the conditions set out in its agreement with him. Because of these  restrictions, Mr. Bourque couldn’t really build his business or make a profit.  That meant he was an employee.  In  this case, a person was found to be an employee under a specific law (the <em>Act respecting collective agreement decrees</em>).  Someone can be considered an employee under one law (for example, the Act) but  not another (for example, employment insurance legislation). Each situation  depends on its own facts."
2019 SCC 22,"<strong>If someone has sexual conversations with a child they  don’t know online, they can’t expect their messages to stay private from the  police, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   In 2012, a police officer created fake Facebook and  Hotmail accounts pretending to be “Leann,” a 14-year-old girl. Mr. Mills  contacted “Leann.” He was 32, but pretended to be 23. Over the next two months,  he sent “Leann” several messages and emails, including a photo of his penis.  Police used software to take screenshots of all the communications. Eventually,  Mr. Mills asked to meet “Leann” in a public park. He was arrested and charged  with child luring. This is the crime of talking to an underage person online (or  using a cellphone) to try to take advantage of them sexually. During his trial, Mr. Mills argued that police weren’t  allowed to run the undercover operation that led to his arrest. He said they  needed a judge’s permission. He said they breached his <em>Charter </em>right to privacy because they didn’t have permission.  Because of the breach, he said the evidence shouldn’t be allowed in court. This  would mean his conversations with “Leann” couldn’t be looked at. Privacy rights are found in Section 8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter  is part of Canada’s Constitution</em>. Section 8 says that “everyone has  the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.” This means the  state can’t search or take something private without permission. To show a  breach of privacy rights, a person has to show that they should have been able  to expect something would be kept private. This is called a “reasonable  expectation of privacy.” Part of this is subjective (that is, the person  actually thinks the thing should be private). Part of it is objective (that is,  most other people would agree it should be private). The state can still search  or take something someone reasonably expects to be private. But it has to have  permission. Permission can be from a judge (like a warrant). It can also be  given if the law directly says so.    In this case, the police said it wasn’t reasonable  for Mr. Mills to expect his conversations with “Leann” would be kept private. They  said they didn’t need permission to run the undercover operation or to  screen-capture the conversations. The trial judge agreed with Mr. Mills that police  should have had a judge’s permission to do some things. The judge said it was okay  for the police officer who posed as “Leann” to capture their conversations on  Facebook and Hotmail. But using software to save screen-caps of the  conversation was an additional step. They should have gotten permission to do  this. But the judge said the evidence should be allowed anyway, and Mr. Mills  was found guilty. The Court of Appeal said the police didn’t need a judge’s  permission. It said Mr. Mills couldn’t expect privacy when he was messaging a  child he didn’t know.  All the  judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Mr. Mills should be found guilty.  The majority said that Mr. Mills didn’t have a  reasonable expectation of privacy. He couldn’t have expected that his messages  would be kept private when he was talking to a child he didn’t know. (If he did  know the child, then the conversations might be private.) In this case, the  police knew for sure Mr. Mills didn’t know “Leann,” because they invented her.  That meant there was no chance of a privacy breach. There was no reason a judge  shouldn’t look at the messages Mr. Mills sent to “Leann” to decide if he was  guilty. This case involved online messages, but the majority said text messages  would also be treated the same when it comes to privacy rights. All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed courts shouldn’t  just look at whether something is <em>actually </em>private. (Just because something is exposed doesn’t mean it isn’t private  anymore.) Instead, they should look at what a person<em> ought</em> to be able to expect to be private in our society. Most  judges agreed it isn’t reasonable to expect this kind of conversation would be  kept private. The Court decided  two other cases involving privacy rights in the months before this one: <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/37676-eng.aspx"">R. v. Reeves</a></em> in December 2018 and <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37833-eng.aspx"">R.  v. Jarvis</a></em> in February 2019. It decided another case about child  luring, <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37687-eng.aspx"">R. v. Morrison</a></em>,  in March 2019. "
2019 SCC 20,"<strong>A judge had the power to step in when a man’s claim was wrongly denied  under the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>
   Canada is  still coming to terms with a terrible part of its history. From the 1860s to  the 1990s, over 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children were taken  from their homes. They were put in boarding schools called “Indian Residential  Schools.” The schools were set up and run by the federal government and  churches together. Many students were physically, sexually, and  psychologically abused there.  Years  later, many of these former students sued for the harms they suffered. They  sued the federal government, churches, and others. The Indian Residential  Schools Settlement Agreement, signed in 2006, settled the lawsuits. This  agreement did many things. It set out a way toward national healing, education,  and reconciliation through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It also set  out ways for people who were harmed to ask for compensation. One of these ways  was through the Independent Assessment Process (IAP).  The IAP  decides what kind of compensation someone should get for specific harm that  they suffered. IAP decisions are made by adjudicators (decision-makers who  aren’t judges). Each province and territory has a “supervising judge” to  oversee how the Settlement Agreement is applied. This is to make sure people get  the compensation and benefits they bargained for. The issue in this case was  whether a judge was allowed to intervene in an adjudicator’s decision. JW went  to a residential school as a young boy. While he was waiting to have a shower,  a nun grabbed his private parts over his clothes. He asked for compensation for  this harm through the IAP. But the decision-maker denied his claim. She said JW  had to prove the nun meant her touch to be sexual. JW asked two IAP  reviewers to look at the decision. They both agreed with the first decision-maker’s  conclusion. JW asked  the supervising judge in Manitoba to look at his case. The judge agreed with JW  that the reviewers had failed to apply the agreement, and said the case should  be heard again by a new decision-maker. This new decision-maker agreed with JW  that he had been sexually abused and said he should be compensated. But before JW  was paid, the federal government appealed the judge’s decision. It said the judge  didn’t have the power to give his own interpretation of the Settlement  Agreement. The Court of Appeal agreed, saying the judge only had the power to look  at whether the IAP decision-maker considered the correct parts of the agreement.  It restored the original decision, which denied JW’s claim. The seven  judges who heard this case at the Supreme Court split three ways. Five judges came  to the same conclusion, but for different reasons. They agreed that JW should  get the benefits the Settlement Agreement promised him. They said that the new  decision-maker’s decision should stand, and JW should receive compensation. The Settlement  Agreement is meant to help Canada come to terms with the damage caused by the  Indian Residential Schools policy. Resolving cases like JW’s is an important  part of this process. "
2019 SCC 19,"<strong>In  Ontario, businesses can’t get out of arbitration agreements by joining class  action lawsuits with consumers, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   When a large group of people have the same legal  problem, they might decide to get together and sue as a group. This is called a  “class action” lawsuit. (The “class” is the group, so it’s a group action.) A  class action lets the whole group get their complaint dealt with in court at  once. Otherwise, each person would have to go to court on their own. Before a  class action can go ahead, a court needs to “certify” (approve) it. Mr. Wellman had a cellphone contract with TELUS. He  said that, for a certain time, TELUS rounded up calls to the next minute  without telling customers. He said customers were overcharged and not given  their full number of minutes. He asked the court to certify a class action  against TELUS on behalf of himself and about two million other customers in  Ontario. About 1.4 million of these customers were consumers (who bought cell  services for personal use). The rest were business customers (who bought  services for business use). Mr. Wellman was asking for over $500 million in  damages on behalf of the group. All of TELUS’s customers agreed to standard terms and  conditions when they signed up. One of these terms was that billing disagreements  had to be decided in “arbitration.” Arbitration is when a neutral third party (other  than a judge or a court) decides a legal dispute. Businesses often use it  because it can be more efficient and less costly than going to court. In Ontario, arbitration rules are set out in the <em>Arbitration Act</em>. One of the Act’s main  principles is that people who agree to go to arbitration should have to live up  to their agreement. There are some exceptions, like when the agreement isn’t valid. One exception is for consumers. The Ontario <em>Consumer Protection Act</em> says consumers can  join a class action like Mr. Wellman’s even if they agreed to arbitration.  Because of this, everyone agreed that the consumers could ask for compensation  in court. But business customers weren’t covered by the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em>. TELUS said this meant they should be held  to their agreement to go to arbitration. It asked the court to “stay” the  claims of the business customers, or stop them from going forward in court. The main issue in this case was how to interpret section  7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act</em>. Mr.  Wellman said the section meant courts could decide to let a claim go to court,  even if it was covered by an arbitration agreement. He said this could happen  if it wouldn’t be reasonable to separate claims covered by the agreement (like  the business customer claims) from claims that weren’t (like the consumer  claims). For him, that meant that <em>both</em> groups should be allowed to ask for compensation in court. TELUS, on the other  hand, said courts <em>had to</em> stay claims covered  by valid arbitration agreements. It said courts could let claims <em>not</em> covered by an agreement go to court.  But claims that <em>were</em> covered (in this  case, the business customer claims) had to be stayed.  Both the motions judge and the Court of Appeal agreed  with Mr. Wellman. They said the business customers could join the class action. The majority at the Supreme Court disagreed. It said section  7(5) didn’t allow the court to refuse to stay claims dealt with in a valid  arbitration agreement. Otherwise, the principle that people should respect  their agreements would be weakened. People would be able to avoid their agreements  just by piggybacking on, or joining their claims to, those of people who <em>weren’t</em> bound to go to arbitration. The  majority noted that the only dispute in this class action was about billing. All  customers agreed this would be dealt with through arbitration. Normally, this  would mean everyone’s claims in the class action would be stayed. It would not  be heard in court at all. But because of the exception in the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em>, consumers were  protected from a stay. Their claims could still be heard. Business customers  weren’t covered by the exception, so they had to respect their agreement. Their  claims were stayed, and they would have to go to arbitration instead. This decision didn’t  deal with Mr. Wellman’s claim that TELUS overbilled its customers. It only  decided that the business customers weren’t allowed to go to court to argue  that."
2019 SCC 18,"<strong>Judges have to make sure that people put in jail while  they wait for trial really need to be there, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
     When someone is charged with a crime, they are presumed innocent until  proven guilty in court. This is why after an arrest, an accused person is  normally released on bail to wait for their trial. However, in special  situations, a judge may decide to keep the person in jail after their arrest.  This is called “remand” or “pre-trial detention.” A person can be put in  pre-trial detention because it’s the only way to make sure they show up for  court, to keep the public safe, or to protect public confidence in the justice  system. Even if a person is eventually found guilty, the presumption of  innocence means that pre-trial detention is supposed to be a last resort. In Canada, many people are kept in jail while waiting for their trials.  On any given day, about half of people in jail in Canada are waiting for their  trial and have not been found guilty. Being in jail makes it harder for them to  defend themselves. People kept in jail before trial may be more likely to plead  guilty. Being in jail also affects their mental and physical well-being, family  life, and jobs. A judge is supposed to look at the situation 90 days after the  person was ordered to go to pre-trial detention. Mr. Myers was arrested in January 2016 and charged  with several crimes, including some firearms crimes. He had been found guilty  of other crimes before, and was on probation when he was arrested. He stayed in  jail to finish that previous sentence. But by October, the only reason he was  in custody was because of his new charges from January. He asked for bail for  the first time in November 2016. The bail judge didn’t think the conditions  suggested by Mr. Myers’ lawyer were enough to protect the public, and said no. Mr.  Myers was supposed to get a detention review after 90 days, but waited many  months longer. The new judge said he could only release Mr. Myers if there was  unreasonable delay or some change in his situation. Mr. Myers didn’t make any  arguments in response, so he wasn’t released. But he appealed, saying the judge’s  approach to the law was wrong. (Most cases get appealed to a court of appeal,  but courts of appeal don’t have the power to look at bail review decisions. So  Mr. Myers had to appeal directly to the Supreme Court of Canada.) The problem was that courts across Canada didn’t agree how 90-day detention  reviews worked. Some said a person could only be released if their case was  taking too long (if there was an “unreasonable delay”). Others said someone  could be released even if there wasn’t an unreasonable delay. Some people  thought that anyone who didn’t have a bail hearing when they were first  arrested didn’t have a right to a review. Others said everyone should get a review,  no matter how they came to be in custody.  The Supreme Court unanimously said these detention reviews are  automatic. The jail or the prosecutor must apply for a hearing 90 days after the  last order putting (or keeping) the person in custody. The judge then has to  schedule a review hearing as soon as possible. The only question the judge has  to decide is whether keeping the person in jail is legally necessary to make  sure they attend trial, to keep the public safe, or to protect public  confidence in the justice system. Delay is just one thing a judge can look at. But  delays don’t necessarily have to be “unreasonable.” What matters is the effect keeping  the person in jail would have on them, now or in the future. For example, a judge  should consider whether the person will spend longer in pre-trial detention than  their sentence would be if they were found guilty. After hearing from both sides,  the judge has to give the person a decision about why they have to stay in jail  (or why they can leave, with or without conditions).  The Court said that judges have special obligations to  make sure detention is justified and that trials are on track. Many accused  people don’t have lawyers, and so judges have to take extra care to make sure  things are fair. Judges can make orders to speed up trials, especially when  people are held in pre-trial detention. "
2019 SCC 15,"<strong>Part of the <em>Criminal Code</em> section dealing with child luring is  unconstitutional because it violates the presumption of innocence, the Supreme  Court has unanimously ruled.</strong>        It’s a crime to talk to an underage person online (or  using a cellphone) to try to take advantage of them sexually. It’s also a crime  if you <em>believe</em> they’re underage, even  if they’re actually not. This is called “child luring.”  Mr. Morrison posted an ad online. Part of the ad’s  title was “Daddy  looking for his little girl.” A police officer pretending to be a 14-year-old  girl named “Mia” responded. Mr. Morrison and “Mia” had sexual conversations online  for over two months. He asked “Mia” to touch herself sexually. He also said she  should skip school so they could meet and engage in sexual acts. He was charged  with child luring. During  his trial, Mr. Morrison said he thought he was talking to an adult woman who  was just pretending to be 14. He also argued that three important points in the  child luring section of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> violated his rights under the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. (The <em>Charter </em>is part of Canada’s constitution.) First, the <em>Criminal Code</em> said that if someone told someone else they were  underage, the law presumed the person believed it. The only exception was if  there was evidence that the person <em>didn’t</em> believe it. Mr. Morrison said this violated his right to be presumed innocent.  Before anyone can be found guilty of a crime, a judge or jury has to believe  that the person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The right to be presumed  innocent is violated whenever a law lets someone be found guilty even though  there is a reasonable doubt. The law presumed Mr. Morrison believed “Mia” when  she said she was 14, even though there could be other explanations. Second, the <em>Criminal  Code </em>said a person <em>wouldn’t</em> be  found guilty if they honestly believed that the other person was of legal age,  even if that belief was wrong. But they could only use this as a defence if  they took “reasonable steps” to find out how old the other person really was. Mr.  Morrison said this violated basic principles of justice. This was because he  could be found guilty simply for not taking “reasonable steps” to find out “Mia’s”  real age. Third, for the most serious cases, the <em>Criminal Code </em>set out a “mandatory  minimum sentence” of one year. The judge couldn’t lower it, even if it would be  too harsh in the circumstances. Mr. Morrison said this violated his right to be  free from cruel and unusual punishment. The  trial judge agreed that the first point violated Mr. Morrison’s right to be  presumed innocent. But he found Mr. Morrison guilty anyway, because he didn’t  take reasonable steps to find out how old “Mia” really was. He agreed, though,  that the mandatory minimum sentence violated the <em>Charter</em>, and ordered a shorter sentence. The Court of Appeal  agreed. All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that the first  point violated the right to be presumed innocent. Just because someone is told  something online doesn’t mean they believe it. People don’t always tell the truth.  Yet the law’s presumption meant that someone could be found guilty even if the  judge or jury had a reasonable doubt about whether they believed the other  person was underage. This violated the presumption of innocence. Most of the judges agreed that the “reasonable steps” requirement  didn’t violate the <em>Charter</em>. But they  said the lower courts misinterpreted it. Mr. Morrison could try to defend  himself by saying he honestly believed “Mia” was of legal age. To succeed,  though, he had to show evidence that he took reasonable steps to find out how  old she really was. But simply proving Mr. Morrison didn’t take reasonable  steps wasn’t, on its own, enough to find him guilty. The Crown (the  prosecution) still had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Morrison <em>believed</em> “Mia” was underage. The majority didn’t decide either way whether the  mandatory minimum sentence violated the <em>Charter</em>.  The lower courts misunderstood how the law worked, and this misunderstanding  wasn’t a good basis to decide this.  Most of the judges agreed there should be a new trial  because of the trial judge’s mistakes. Two previous Supreme  Court cases dealt with the child luring section of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. But this was the first time the Court looked at whether  it violated the <em>Charter</em>."
2019 SCC 14,"<strong>A lawyer who repeatedly recommended that his clients  invest money in funds promoted by his friend’s firm was responsible for the  clients’ losses when it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>
   People hire lawyers to help them make important  decisions. They have to be able to trust them. That means trusting they are  capable, careful, and will act in the client's interests, not anyone else's. To  help guarantee this trust, lawyers have certain ethical and professional  duties. In Quebec, two of these are the “duty to advise” and the “duty of  loyalty.”
   The duty  to advise means several things. It means the lawyer has to tell the client all  the relevant facts. They have to explain the possible consequences of an  action. And they have to recommend what the client should do. How far this duty  goes depends on a few things. These include the client’s experience and  knowledge, the reason the lawyer was hired, and what expertise the lawyer says  they have. The duty of loyalty means the lawyer has to be loyal to the client.  Lawyers can’t put themselves in situations where things they want might go  against things their clients want. Mr. Salomon was a lawyer. He  had been the lawyer for some of the Thompsons’ businesses for many years. In  2003, Ms. Matte-Thompson asked him for advice. Mr. Thompson had died and left  her money in trust. She wanted to live off the interest only and save the rest  for the children. Mr. Salomon introduced Ms. Matte-Thompson to his personal friend,  Mr. Papadopoulos, and recommended the services of his firm, Triglobal Capital Management.  He said investing in one of the funds promoted by Mr. Papadopoulos’s firm would  help Ms. Matte-Thompson achieve her goals.  With Mr. Salomon’s  encouragement, Ms. Matte-Thompson and the company she owned invested with  Triglobal and kept their investments there. Over the years, they invested over  $7.5 million in two funds. In 2006, Ms. Matte-Thompson told Mr. Salomon she was  worried about the investments. He reassured her and told her to keep investing.  He also told Mr. Papadopoulos to reassure her. In 2007, Mr. Papadopoulos and  his business partner disappeared with almost $100 million. This included over  $5 million invested by Ms. Matte-Thompson and her company. Later, Ms.  Matte-Thompson found out Mr. Papadopoulos had paid Mr. Salomon almost $40,000  during the years he advised her and her company. In 2008, Ms. Matte-Thompson and  her company sued Mr. Salomon and his law firm. She said Mr. Salomon had failed  in his duty to advise. This was because he recommended, endorsed, and  encouraged inappropriate investments. She also said he disregarded his duty of  loyalty. This was because he put himself in a conflict of interest, which  caused him to ignore the risks.     The trial judge said Mr.  Papadopoulos and his partner were responsible for the losses. But she said Mr.  Salomon was not. The Court of Appeal said the trial judge made important mistakes.  It said Mr. Salomon was responsible, and reversed the trial judge’s decision. The  majority at the Supreme Court said the Court of Appeal was right to intervene. The  trial judge failed to look at Mr. Salomon’s actions as a whole from 2003 to  2007. It agreed with the Court of Appeal that Mr. Salomon failed in his duty to  advise Ms. Matte-Thompson and her company. This was because he encouraged Ms.  Matte-Thompson to invest and keep her money (and the company’s money) in the  funds over many years, even though they didn’t meet her goals. He never looked  into the funds he was recommending, but kept telling her the investments were  safe. The majority agreed that Ms. Matte-Thompson would have never invested in  Triglobal funds if Mr. Salomon hadn’t failed in his duty to advise. It also agreed  that Mr. Salomon disregarded his duty of loyalty. His friendship and investments  with Mr. Papadopoulos put him in a conflict of interest. He even told Mr.  Papadopoulos about Ms. Matte-Thompson’s private fears and concerns. Mr.  Papadopoulos also paid Mr. Salomon while he was advising Ms. Matte-Thompson and  her company. It was wrong for him to advise them in this situation.  This case was about  what lawyers are responsible for when they go beyond just referring clients to  another professional. The decision doesn’t mean lawyers take on more risk  recommending someone now than they did before. Lawyers can refer their clients  to others. They just have to follow their professional and ethical duties when  they do so."
2019 SCC 13,"<strong>It’s contradictory for Quebec residents to argue that a foreign court  doesn’t have the power to decide a lawsuit against them, while bringing up  points the court could use to resolve the dispute in their favour, the Supreme  Court has ruled. </strong>
   Laws are local. A law passed in one place doesn’t  automatically apply somewhere else. This means you can’t take a court judgment  from one place (e.g., where you live) and get it automatically enforced in  another (e.g., where someone who owes you money lives). Because laws are local,  courts only have “jurisdiction” (power) in their own territories. But life and  business today cross borders, so there are rules about how to deal with foreign  court decisions fairly and efficiently. These rules are part of a branch of law  known as “private international law” or “conflict of laws.”  For  a foreign decision to be enforced in Quebec, a Quebec court must decide to accept  (or “recognize”) it in the province. This doesn’t mean looking at all the facts  and arguments again. It just means the Quebec court will apply Quebec rules to decide  if the foreign court had jurisdiction over the Quebec resident. Foreign court  decisions will usually be recognized, with some exceptions. One way a foreign court’s decision can be accepted and enforced in  Quebec is if the Quebec resident has recognized the foreign court’s authority.  In legal terms, this is called “submitting to the jurisdiction.” If the Quebec  resident didn’t submit, the Quebec court may decide not to enforce the foreign  judgment. In such a case, the person suing the Quebec resident won’t be able to  be paid in Quebec, even though the foreign court has ordered it. That means it’s  important to know whether a Quebec resident who is sued abroad has submitted to  the foreign court’s jurisdiction. But this  isn’t always clear. You can submit explicitly by saying so, but you can also  submit implicitly by your actions. Judges and legal thinkers have disagreed about  which actions will be considered signs of submission. In particular, they’ve  disagreed about whether someone <em>really </em>submits  when they argue about the “merits” to avoid a bad outcome while also saying the  foreign court doesn’t have jurisdiction. (The “merits” are the facts and legal  substance of the case.) This was the issue in Mr. Barer’s  case. Mr. Barer was a Quebec resident. He was president of two companies, one  based in Montreal and one based in the US state of Vermont. Knight Brothers was  based in the US state of Utah, where the Vermont-based company was involved in  a project. After a contract dispute over the project, Knight Brothers sued Mr.  Barer and both of his companies in a Utah court. Mr. Barer asked the Utah court to summarily dismiss the lawsuit against him (that is,  to dismiss it without a full hearing). He said the court didn’t have  jurisdiction, but also argued that there were legal reasons why Knight  Brothers’ claim couldn’t succeed. The judge rejected his motion to dismiss and Mr.  Barer didn’t defend himself any more. The Utah court eventually ruled for  Knight Brothers. Because Mr. Barer lived (and had assets) in Quebec, Knight  Brothers asked a Quebec court to recognize the decision.  The trial judge said the decision  could be recognized in Quebec. It said Mr. Barer had submitted to the Utah  court’s jurisdiction by arguing the merits of the case in his motion to dismiss.  The judge said Mr. Barer had to pay Knight Brothers over $1.2 million. The Court  of Appeal dismissed his appeal. The majority at  the Supreme Court agreed that the Utah judgment should be recognized in Quebec.  It said defendants submit to a court’s jurisdiction when they make arguments  that (if accepted) would resolve the dispute – or part of the dispute – on its  merits. It would be unfair and inefficient if someone could try to convince a  foreign court on the merits while still being able to challenge jurisdiction at  home if they didn’t like the result. When Mr. Barer argued the merits of the  case in his motion to dismiss, he submitted to the Utah court’s jurisdiction  under Quebec law. If the Utah court had accepted  this argument, it would have decided in his favour on that issue and Knight  Brothers would have had to accept it. Mr. Barer made a strategic choice, and he  had to accept the consequences.This case was  specific to Quebec law, found in Quebec’s <em>Civil  Code</em>. The <em>Civil Code</em> applies to  non-criminal legal issues in Quebec.

2019 SCC 10,"<strong>A teacher who recorded students with a hidden camera is guilty of  voyeurism, the Supreme Court has ruled. Students doing normal activities at  school don’t give up their privacy rights even though technology makes it  easier to record them.</strong>
   Voyeurism  became a crime in the <em>Criminal Code</em> in 2005. It is when someone secretly watches or records someone else who reasonably  expects privacy, in one of three specific situations. One of the situations is  where the watching or recording is done for a sexual purpose. Every  crime in the <em>Criminal Code</em> has  specific requirements or “elements” that are part of that crime’s definition.  When someone is found “guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” it means that each  element of the crime has been proven against them beyond a reasonable doubt.  For the crime of voyeurism, there are three elements. They are (1) the secret watching  or recording, (2) the reasonable expectation of privacy of the person being  watched or recorded, and (3) the specific situation (e.g., the sexual purpose). Mr.  Jarvis was a high school teacher. He used a camera hidden inside a pen to  record female students doing ordinary school activities in classrooms,  hallways, and other common areas. Most of the videos focused on female students’  faces and upper bodies, especially their chests. The students didn’t know they  were being recorded. The videos were of high quality and could be downloaded  onto a computer. The  trial judge looked at the evidence and said the students had a reasonable  expectation of privacy. But he wasn’t convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that  Mr. Jarvis made the recordings for a sexual purpose. He found Mr. Jarvis not  guilty because of this. The majority of the Court of Appeal said there was  proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Jarvis <em>had</em> made the videos for a sexual purpose. But it didn’t think the  students had a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time. It also said Mr.  Jarvis was not guilty. The  Supreme Court had to decide one question. This was whether students could have  reasonably expected privacy—specifically, privacy from the type of secret  recording Mr. Jarvis did—in the common areas of their school. All of the other  elements had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Mr. Jarvis should be found guilty. They  said the students reasonably expected not to be recorded by a teacher’s hidden camera  at school. To determine when someone should be reasonably able to expect  privacy, the majority said courts need to look at the entire situation. This  could include where the watching or recording happened, how it was done, and  any rules or policies in place. It could also include whether the person was  just watching or was recording (because a recording can capture more detail, is  permanent, and can be easily viewed, edited, and shared). It could also include  looking at the relationship between the parties. The majority also looked at  the way privacy has been defined in <em>Charter</em> cases. Technology has made it much easier to get, store, and share information  about others. But the majority said that doesn’t mean people have to give up  their right to privacy just because there is a risk it can be violated. Technology  may make it easier to violate someone’s privacy, but that doesn’t mean a person  should have to accept it.  In  this case, the majority noted the students were recorded in a school. The  recording violated school board policy, as well as the relationship of trust  between a teacher and a student. The videos targeted particular female  students, often focusing on their breasts. The students would never expect to  be recorded in such a way, by a teacher, in their school. They clearly had a  reasonable expectation of privacy.  This case came to the Supreme Court as an appeal “as  of right.” That means there is an automatic right to appeal, and the Court’s  permission isn’t needed. The right is automatic in criminal cases when a Court  of Appeal judge dissents (disagrees) on a point of law, as happened here. Both  the person charged and the Crown (the prosecution) can appeal when this  happens. In this case, the Crown appealed. This was the first time the elements  of the crime of voyeurism in s. 162(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> were considered by the Court."
2019 SCC 7,"<strong>An offender should have challenged a long-term supervision order directly, instead of challenging it <em>indirectly</em> after he was charged with violating it, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
     Mr.  Bird was a “long-term offender” with over 60 criminal convictions. Long-term  offenders are at higher risk of committing more crimes in the future. Because  of this, they are “supervised” after they finish their prison sentences to make  sure they stay out of trouble. They have to report to corrections officials on  a regular basis. They may have to live in a certain place or be home by a  certain time, or follow other conditions.  Long-term  supervision is meant to protect the public. It is also meant to help long-term  offenders re-enter society. A judge decides the length of a long-term  supervision order. The Parole Board sets the conditions. The Parole Board is an  “administrative” body (meaning it is set up by Parliament to do things on  behalf of the state—in this case, deal with parole and related matters). This  means a long-term supervision order is an “administrative” order rather than a  court order. Still, violating one is a crime.The punishment is up to ten years in prison. In  2013, after being convicted on a weapons charge, Mr. Bird was sentenced to a  year in prison. He hoped to return to his First Nation in north central  Saskatchewan and live with his brother after finishing his prison sentence. But  the Parole Board decided he would be too much of a risk to the community. It ordered  him to live in a “community correctional centre” (a halfway house) in Regina  for about six months after his prison sentence. This was a “residency  condition” of his long-term supervision order. Before  his prison sentence ended, Mr. Bird got a letter from the Parole Board. It said  he could ask the Parole Board to consider changing or removing any of the  conditions of his long-term supervision order. He never did. Less than a month  after his long-term supervision began, Mr. Bird left the halfway house and didn’t  come back. He was arrested over two months later and charged with violating the  order. Mr.  Bird fought the charge. He argued that the residency condition was  unconstitutional. He said the Parole Board didn’t have the power to impose the  condition. He said the condition violated his right to liberty under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  He argued that being forced to live at the halfway house was like being forced  to live in prison. He said long-term supervision orders weren't meant to put  people back in prison after they served their time.  The  trial judge accepted Mr. Bird’s argument. He ruled that the residency condition  was unconstitutional, so Mr. Bird couldn’t be found guilty of violating it. The  Court of Appeal disagreed. It said Mr. Bird wasn’t allowed to launch a  “collateral attack” on the residency condition. A collateral attack is an <em>indirect</em> attack on an order or decision,  through a new or separate case. In this case, a <em>direct</em> attack would have been doing what the letter said and asking  the Parole Board to think about changing or removing the residency condition. The  Court of Appeal found Mr. Bird guilty of violating the order.  The majority at the Supreme Court agreed that the collateral attack was  not allowed. Because long-term supervision orders are “administrative” orders, it  had to look at what Parliament intended. The key question was whether Parliament  meant to allow long-term offenders to launch collateral attacks on these  orders. To determine Parliament’s intent, the majority looked at a number of  factors. It looked at the wording and purposes of different laws. It looked at  whether Mr. Bird could have challenged the order in other ways. It looked at  the Parole Board’s expertise in long-term supervision orders. And it looked at the  punishment for violating the order. In the end, the majority said that  Parliament didn’t intend to allow long-term offenders like Mr. Bird to launch  collateral attacks on their long-term supervision orders in criminal  proceedings. It noted that he had several options to challenge the condition.  It said Parliament meant for him to use these rather than indirectly attacking  the condition after he violated it. It sent the case back to the Provincial  Court to decide a sentence. Courts  don’t have to decide every question parties ask them. In this case, the  majority didn’t need to decide whether the residency condition was actually unconstitutional,  because Parliament didn’t intend to allow collateral attacks."
2019 SCC 6,"<strong>Repeated and extreme attempts to destroy evidence can, in some  circumstances, be used to infer intention to commit murder, the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>
   Ms.  Jordan went missing in 2013. Police suspected that her partner, Mr. Calnen,  murdered her. They arrested him. During questioning, Mr. Calnen said Ms. Jordan  died accidentally. He said that she was going to leave him and they argued. He  said Ms. Jordan became physically aggressive. He said she tried to punch him,  but he ducked and she fell down the stairs and died.  Mr.  Calnen said he panicked. He said he’d used crack cocaine on the way home, and  again after Ms. Jordan died. He didn’t want to call police. He said he hid her  body in the woods, but came back to move it a couple of times, and burned it in  two different places. He said he placed Ms. Jordan’s ashes near her family  cottage, because that’s what Ms. Jordan had said she wanted done with her ashes  if she died. He said he put the parts that were not fully burned by the fire in  the lake. Police  found some burned belongings in the woods and unidentifiable bone fragments in  the lake. They also found text messages. Some seemed to suggest Mr. Calnen may  have been abusive toward Ms. Jordan. Others showed her plans to leave him and  steal his property. Mr.  Calnen was charged with second-degree murder (intentionally causing Ms.  Jordan’s death). He was also charged with indecent interference with human  remains (damaging or disrespecting a dead person’s body). He pleaded guilty to  the interference charge at the start of the trial, but said he didn’t kill her.  A jury found him guilty of second-degree murder. The majority of the Court of  Appeal said the trial judge made a mistake in his instructions to the jury. It  overturned the murder conviction. It said that if there were a retrial, it  should be for manslaughter, not murder. Second-degree  murder is more serious than manslaughter. That’s because someone who murders intends  to kill (or at least cause serious harm), while someone who commits  manslaughter doesn’t. Everyone agreed that the jury could use Mr. Calnen’s  attempts to destroy Ms. Jordan’s body to infer he killed her and was guilty of <em>manslaughter</em>. The question was whether  it could use these attempts to infer he intended to <em>murder</em> her. Inferences have to be based on logic, common sense, and  experience. Some can be stronger than others. For example, if there is no other  reasonable explanation, an inference will be strong. Judges can tell juries  what kinds of inferences they are allowed to make. In this case, there was no  direct physical evidence (like blood or video) that Mr. Calnen killed Ms.  Jordan, so proper inferences were important. All  judges at the Supreme Court agreed, in principle, that someone’s actions after  a suspected murder can (in some circumstances) be used to infer their intent to  commit second-degree murder. Most of the judges agreed, in this case, that evidence  about Mr. Calnen’s actions after Ms. Jordan died could be used to infer his  intent for second-degree murder. If Mr. Calnen hadn’t destroyed the body, it  could have showed how she died and revealed something about his intent. For  example, if Ms. Jordan had been stabbed, it would have been obvious her death  wasn’t an accident. It would have been open to the jury to find that Mr. Calnen  intentionally killed her. Inferring that he moved and burned her body to hide  what he had done was common sense. Another  issue in this case was the trial judge’s instructions to the jury. After juries  hear all the evidence, they get instructions from the judge about how to decide  if a person is guilty. These are meant to make sure juries make decisions based  on the law and the evidence (not feelings or hunches). The question was whether  the judge made an error by not specifically telling the jury what inferences it  was allowed to make about Mr. Calnen’s actions after Ms. Jordan died. The  majority said judges have to give <em>proper</em> instructions, not perfect ones, so  the trial judge didn’t make any error. It restored Mr. Calnen’s  second-degree murder conviction. This case came to the Supreme Court as an appeal “as  of right.” That means the right to appeal is automatic, and the Court’s  permission isn’t needed. The right was automatic in this case because a Court  of Appeal judge dissented (disagreed) on a point of criminal law."
2019 SCC 5,"<strong>After going bankrupt, an oil and gas company has to fulfill provincial  environmental obligations before paying anyone it owes money to, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>
   Redwater was an Alberta oil and gas company. It owned over  a hundred wells, pipelines, and facilities when it went bankrupt in 2015.  Bankruptcy is what happens when a person or company  can’t pay debts. Under the <em>Bankruptcy and  Insolvency Act </em>(BIA), a trustee manages the process. Anyone who can prove  they are owed money can make a claim, called a “claim provable in bankruptcy.” Anyone  with a provable claim will get paid in a certain order set out in the BIA. They  won’t get paid, though, if there is no money left. Other claims fall outside of  the payment order. The bankrupt company’s “estate” (its leftover money and  property) is still responsible for them, despite the bankruptcy. Under the  Constitution, only the federal government has power to make laws on bankruptcy,  so the BIA is a federal law. The Constitution also gives provinces power to make  laws in specific areas. These include natural resources and property rights.  Using these powers, Alberta passed laws saying oil and gas companies need a  licence to operate. As part of the licence, companies have to ""abandon”  wells, pipelines, and facilities when they are done. This means permanently taking  these structures down. They also have to “reclaim"" the land (by cleaning  it up). Companies can’t transfer licences without permission from the Alberta  Energy Regulator. They won’t get it if they haven’t met their responsibilities. Most of Redwater’s wells were dry when it went  bankrupt. Dismantling the sites and restoring the land would have cost millions  of dollars more than they were worth. To avoid paying these costs, the trustee  decided not to take responsibility for (basically, to disown) the useless wells  and sites. It said it was allowed to do this under the BIA. It wanted to sell  the productive sites to pay people Redwater owed money to. The Regulator said  that this wasn’t allowed under the BIA or provincial law. It ordered the  trustee to dismantle the disowned sites. The trustee said that even if the  Regulator was right, the provincial abandonment orders were provable claims  under the BIA. This meant the money would first go to pay people Redwater owed. The problem was that the federal and  provincial laws seemed to contradict each other. When laws are applied, they  sometimes overlap. This happens even when governments stick to their own areas  under the Constitution. It often comes up in bankruptcy cases. Where a valid provincial law conflicts with a valid federal law, the  federal law will normally apply—as far as the conflict goes. (Federal and  provincial laws should be understood as being in harmony, where possible.) In  constitutional law, this is known as the “doctrine of paramountcy.”  There were two main legal issues. The first was whether  the BIA said the trustee could simply walk away from sites it didn’t take  responsibility for. The second was whether the provincial orders to remove  structures from the land were provable claims under the BIA. If they were, that  would mean the payment order set up in the BIA applied. Only money left at the  end—if there was any—could be used to pay for taking the sites down. The trial judge said the trustee was allowed to walk  away from the disowned sites and the abandonment costs were provable claims.  The majority at the Court of Appeal agreed. The majority at the Supreme Court said the trustee couldn’t walk away from the disowned sites. It said the BIA was  meant to protect trustees from having to pay for a bankrupt estate’s environmental  claims with their <em>own</em> money. It  didn’t mean Redwater’s estate could avoid its environmental obligations. The  majority also said the abandonment costs were not provable claims. These  costs weren’t <em>debts</em> requiring  payments—they were <em>duties</em> (to the  public and nearby landowners). This put the abandonment costs outside the BIA’s  payment order scheme. That meant there was actually no conflict between the  federal and provincial laws.  In  this case, the trustee had already sold or given up all of Redwater’s assets.  The money from the sales was held “in trust” (that is, by a court) during the  lawsuit. This money must now be used to abandon and reclaim the land before anything  is paid to anyone Redwater owed money to."
2019 SCC 4,"<strong>A trust set up for a person with disabilities shouldn’t  disqualify them from their landlord’s rental assistance program, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>
   Ms. A. was living with disabilities and receiving social  assistance (government) benefits. After her father died, some money was put “in  trust” for her in 2012. When something is “in trust,” it means someone (a  “trustee”) takes care of it for the benefit of someone else. There are many  kinds of trusts to meet many different needs. This kind, called a “Henson  trust,” was designed to let someone put aside money or property for a person  with disabilities. Henson trusts try to do this in a way that still lets the person  get government benefits. Henson trusts aren’t normally counted as “assets” for  programs that require proof of income or assets. This is because the trustee  has full power to decide whether, and how much, to pay the person with  disabilities. The person can’t force the trustee to make any payments. In this  case, Ms. A. and her sister were co-trustees and had to agree on all decisions  together.  Ms. A. lived in an affordable housing complex run by  Metro Vancouver Housing Corporation. To qualify for affordable housing, a  person had to show they had a low income each year. Metro Vancouver Housing  also had a rental assistance program to lower monthly rent payments even more for  tenants with less than $25,000 in assets. But due to the program’s limited  funds, not everyone who was eligible could actually get assistance. Tenants  applied by filling out a form. Ms. A. applied and got assistance when she moved  in in 1992, and got it every year after. Ms. A. applied again in 2015, as she did every year. This  time, Metro Vancouver Housing said the trust counted as an asset, and would be  used to decide if she could still be considered for the program. Ms. A. said  the trust wasn’t an asset that could affect her eligibility, and refused to tell  Metro Vancouver Housing how much it was worth. Metro Vancouver Housing said it  couldn’t process Ms. A.’s application because she didn’t provide the  information. She stopped getting rental assistance as a result. The B.C. Supreme Court and Court of Appeal both said  the trust was an asset that could disqualify Ms. A. from consideration for rental  assistance. The majority at the Supreme Court of Canada disagreed.  It said Metro Vancouver Housing had a duty under contract to consider Ms. A.’s application  for rental assistance. The application and its related agreements (including  the lease) together made up the contract between Ms. A. and Metro Vancouver  Housing. The main issue was the meaning of the word “asset” in the application.  The majority looked at what both Ms. A. and Metro Vancouver Housing understood  the word to mean. “Asset” wasn’t defined in any of the documents that were part  of the contract. It was defined in a Metro Vancouver Housing policy, but the  application didn’t refer to the policy. The majority noted that in everyday  use, “asset” means some kind of valuable property that a person can actually  use to pay for things. It said it should have this meaning in the rental  assistance application. The majority explained that Ms. A’s Henson trust didn’t  meet this definition of “asset.” That’s because she had no control over whether  she’d get any money from the trust, and couldn’t count on it to pay rent. (The  majority said it wasn’t relevant that Ms. A. was a co-trustee, because she had  no right to make any payments to herself on her own. All decisions had to be  unanimous with the other trustee.)  Because the trust wasn’t an “asset” under the application,  the majority said it couldn’t disqualify Ms. A from the rental assistance  program. Metro Vancouver Housing didn’t have to give Ms. A. rental assistance—but  it did have a duty to consider her request. It breached this duty by not doing so  when she applied in 2015. The majority sent the case back to the trial judge to  decide how much Ms. A. should receive in compensation. It said the amount should  put her as close as possible to the position she would have been in if Metro  Vancouver Housing hadn’t breached its duty.  This was the first  time the Supreme Court looked at Henson trusts. The majority didn’t say a  Henson trust could <em>never</em> be treated  as an asset, but only that it would depend on the criteria of the specific  program."
2019 SCC 1,"<strong>A rule preventing citizens from voting in federal elections if they’ve been  living outside Canada for more than five years is unconstitutional, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>
     The <em>Canada  Elections Act</em> sets out the rules for federal elections in Canada. It says  who can vote and how elections are held, while making sure the election process  is fair. The Act says that any citizen age 18 or older can vote if they  normally live in Canada.  One of the rules found in the Act was challenged in  this case. It said that citizens who had been living abroad for less than five  years, and who intended to return to Canada, could also vote in federal  elections. Citizens who had been living abroad longer than five years generally  couldn’t vote. (There were some exceptions, including for members of the  military and government employees posted in other countries.) Over a million Canadian citizens living abroad hadn’t  been allowed to vote because of the rule. Many had strong employment, family,  and social ties to Canada. Some received pensions from or paid taxes to Canada.  Many couldn’t vote anywhere  else in the world.  Two Canadian citizens, Dr. Frank and Mr. Duong, were  not allowed to vote in the Canadian federal election in 2011. This was because  they had been living outside of Canada for more than five years. Both had  strong ties to Canada and hoped to return if they could find suitable jobs.  Both Mr. Duong and Dr. Frank challenged the rule that  prevented them from voting. They said it breached section 3 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> because  it denied them their right to vote, and so was unconstitutional. Section 3 says  (in part) that every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in a federal  election. The Attorney General, on behalf of the federal  government, agreed that the rule breached section 3. However, breaches of <em>Charter</em> rights can be allowed in some  situations. Section 1 of the <em>Charter </em>says  that certain rights can be limited, but only if the limit is reasonable and can  be justified in a free and democratic society. The Attorney General argued that  the rule was reasonable and justified under section 1. The judge who first heard the case said that the rule limiting  the right to vote wasn’t justified. The Court of Appeal disagreed and said the  rule was constitutional. The  majority at the Supreme Court said the rule breached section 3 and wasn’t  justified by section 1, so it struck the rule down. It said Canadian citizens  should be allowed to vote in federal elections, even if they have been living  abroad for longer than five years. The majority noted that section 3 doesn’t say anything about  residence. In our system, residence helps determine <em>where</em> you vote, but not <em>if</em> you can vote.  When deciding  whether a law that breaches the <em>Charter</em> is justified under section 1, courts first look at whether the law has a  “pressing and substantial objective” (an important purpose). If it does, they  then look at whether it is “proportionate” (that is, whether it balances the  law’s purpose with how it is achieved). In this case, the majority said that  fairness to voters living in Canada and fairness in elections were important  goals. But it said the rule wasn’t proportionate. For a rule to be proportionate, it has to  meet three criteria. It must be rationally (or logically) connected to Parliament’s  purpose. Second, it has to limit the <em>Charter </em>right as little as possible. Third, it has to properly balance good and bad  effects. In this case, there was no evidence anyone ever complained about  non-resident voting, so the rule didn’t seem to be rationally connected to the  goal of fair elections. But the majority didn’t need to decide this  specifically, because the rule didn’t meet the other two criteria. It harmed  citizens’ rights more than necessary because it was so broad it denied people  with strong ties to Canada (despite long absences) their right to vote. This  didn’t support the purpose of electoral fairness. Finally, the majority said  the rule’s bad effects outweighed the good ones.This decision confirms that the right to vote is a  basic and important democratic right, not a mere privilege. That means Parliament  can’t limit it easily. The parts of the <em>Canada  Elections Act</em> that limit the voting rights of non-resident citizens are no  longer in force.

2020 SCC 45,"<strong>Even when someone is allowed to put an end to a contract, this has to be  done in an honest way, the Supreme Court has decided.</strong>
   Mr.  Callow ran a property maintenance business. In 2010, his company concluded a  contract with some condo corporations. The contract was for things like  clearing away snow and it lasted for two winters. The company made a new  contract with the condo corporations in 2012. It was supposed to last two more  winters. But if the condo corporations weren’t happy, the contract said they  could end it for any reason. They just had to give ten days’ notice. In  the winter of 2012 to 2013, some people complained that snow wasn’t always  removed from their parking spots. Mr. Callow came to a meeting to talk about  the problem. The meeting went well. Everyone seemed happy enough. A few months  later, the condo buildings got a new property manager, Ms. Zollinger. Ms.  Zollinger told the committee in charge of the contract that they should put an end  to it before the next winter. The committee decided to end the contract but no  one told Mr. Callow. Mr.  Callow thought everyone was happy with his services. People from the condo  corporations talked to him and led him to believe that he would probably get  another contract for more winters. He thought this was true. He also had a  summer contract with the condo corporations. During the summer, he did extra  work for free because he wanted to encourage them to renew the winter contract. In  September 2013, the condo corporations told Mr. Callow they were putting an end  to the winter contract. They gave him ten days’ notice. Mr. Callow didn’t think  this was fair. It was too late to find a new contract for the winter. He said  the condo corporations didn’t live up to their “duty of honest performance.”  This duty means that people who make contracts together can’t lie to or mislead  each other on purpose in doing what they have agreed to in the contract. It’s  part of every contract, even if the parties do not want to include it.  Mr.  Callow sued. He asked the court for over $80,000. This was to cover breaking  the contract, not being honest with him, and the extra services he gave the  condo corporations for free. The condo corporations said they had lived up to  their duty. They said not telling Mr. Callow certain things didn’t mean they had  been dishonest with him. The  trial judge said the condo corporations knew they were going to put an end to the  contract. But they actively misled Mr. Callow into thinking it was safe, and  that it would likely get renewed again, by communicating with him in a way that  suggested this. The trial judge said he should be paid for everything except  the free services. The Court of Appeal disagreed, though. It said that the  condo corporations had not been dishonest. It also said anything the condo  corporations did to mislead Mr. Callow was about the next contract (for the  next two winters he hoped to be hired for), not the current one. There was no  duty of honest performance for a contract that didn’t exist yet. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the condo corporations breached  the contract. The condo corporations had a duty to act honestly toward Mr.  Callow. They were dishonest in how they dealt with putting an end to the  contract. They actively misled Mr. Callow to believe they were happy with his  work and that the contract would not be ended early. The majority said the dishonesty  was about the current contract because the condo corporations acted dishonestly  in putting an end to it. The  majority said the duty of honest performance doesn’t mean one side has to  sacrifice their interests for the other. It didn’t mean the condo corporations  had to tell Mr. Callow that they were going to end the contract early. But it  did mean they couldn’t mislead him about it. They couldn’t pretend it would be  renewed once they knew it would be ended.  Contracts  are agreements that give people rights against each other. The majority said  that no one is allowed to exercise a right under a contract in a dishonest way.  The civil law and  the common law are two Canadian legal traditions. Civil law, historically  related to French law, is used for law about contracts in Quebec. Common law, historically  related to English law, is used in the rest of Canada. Even though this case  was decided under the law of Ontario, the majority looked at civil law sources  from Quebec to help illustrate how the case should be decided in the common law.  The majority said that ideas from the civil law were useful to understand  whether the dishonesty was about the current contract."
2020 SCC 43,"<strong>Hydro-Québec could make a company pay government charges  based on a contract with a power company which was transferred to it, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
  In  1926, the Canadian International Paper Company concluded a contract with the  Gatineau Power Company. The paper company agreed to pay the power company for  electricity to run its mills.  The  contract said the paper company could have to cover any “taxes or charges” the  power company paid to the Quebec government. The contract also said it would apply  to the “successors or assigns” of both companies. That meant anyone who took  over the company’s rights would have to follow it. The  Quebec government created Hydro-Québec in the 1940s. The government wanted to  nationalize electricity (that is, make it publicly-owned). In the 1960s,  Hydro-Québec bought most of Gatineau Power’s shares. Hydro-Québec supplied  power to the paper company, and the paper company paid for it, like the 1926  contract said. The paper company concluded a contract with Hydro-Québec for  more power in 1982. That contract referred to the contract with Gatineau Power  in 1926. The paper company’s electricity bills came from Hydro-Québec from at  least 1999 on.  In  2007, the Government of Quebec started making Hydro-Québec pay two yearly amounts.  In 2011, Hydro-Québec sent the paper company a bill for $3 million to cover  these amounts.  Hydro-Québec  said it could do this because of the 1926 contract. It said Gatineau Power  “assigned” (transferred) the contract to Hydro-Québec in 1965. The paper  company said the 1965 contract made Hydro-Québec a “mandatary” of Gatineau  Power. That meant Hydro-Québec was acting on behalf of Gatineau Power, not on  behalf of itself. The paper company said its contract was with Gatineau Power.  It said it didn’t owe Hydro-Québec anything. Even if this wasn’t the case, it  said assigning the contract wasn’t allowed. It also said the amounts weren’t  “taxes or charges.” (Everyone agreed the paper company that signed the contract  in 1926 eventually became Resolute FP.)  The  trial judge said Gatineau Power didn’t assign the 1926 contract to Hydro-Québec.  She said the 1965 contract made Hydro-Québec a “mandatary” of Gatineau Power.  She also said the amounts owed weren’t “taxes or charges.” That meant Resolute  FP didn’t have to pay. The Court of Appeal said the 1926 contract <em>was </em>assigned by the 1965 contract. It also  said the amounts <em>were </em>“taxes or  charges.”  The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeal, but  for different reasons. They said the trial judge made important mistakes in  saying the 1965 contract was a “mandate.” (That is, it made Hydro-Québec a  “mandatary” acting on Gatineau Power’s behalf.) This meant the Court of Appeal could  intervene.  The  majority said Gatineau Power assigned the contract with the paper company to  Hydro-Québec in 1965. If Hydro-Québec was acting on <em>behalf</em> of Gatineau Power, like Resolute FP argued, Hydro-Québec  wouldn’t get to keep the profits for itself. And it wouldn’t be responsible for  the debts owed to Resolute FP itself. The  majority said that a party to a contract needs the other party’s permission to  assign it to someone else. In this case, Gatineau Power had the permission in  advance. The 1926 contract said it was allowed. The paper company (which later  became Resolute FP) also knew it was doing business with Hydro-Québec since at  least 1982.  The majority said it didn    ’t matter if the amounts  charged by the government were considered “taxes” or not. That’s because the  1926 contract said the paper company would have to pay increases in “taxes or  charges.” It also didn’t matter if Hydro-Québec was owned by the government.  Provinces are allowed to tax or charge Crown corporations (corporations they  own). Hydro-Québec could ask Resolute FP to cover these taxes or charges  because it was assigned the 1926 contract, and that contract said so.  The <em>Civil Code  of Qu</em><em>ébec</em> applies  to most non-criminal legal issues in Quebec. Part of the issue in this case was  that there weren’t explicit rules about assigning contracts in the <em>Civil Code</em>. The Court last looked at a  contract that was assigned in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37813-eng.aspx"">Modern  Cleaning Concept Inc. v. Comité paritaire</a></em>."
2020 SCC 38,"<strong>Part of Ontario’s sex-offender registry law discriminates against people  with mental disabilities, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled.</strong>
   In  2001, G had his first and only mental health episode. He was charged with two  counts of sexual assault against his then-wife. In 2002, he was found “not  criminally responsible on account of mental disorder.” This meant that he did  not know what he was doing or did not know that it was wrong, or both. It also  meant he didn’t have any kind of criminal record. The Ontario Review Board decides  if someone found not criminally responsible is a risk to public safety. It said  G wasn’t a major risk. It gave him an “absolute discharge” in 2003. This meant  he didn’t need to be monitored by the Review Board. He was never charged with  any other crime again. Even  though he got the absolute discharge from the Review Board, G was placed on Ontario’s  sex offender registry. Because of this, he had to report to the police every  year. Police could also randomly check up on him. His name couldn’t be deleted  from the list, even if he died. Sexual  crimes are very serious. But not everyone who commits a sexual crime has to  register in Ontario. Anyone who gets a “discharge” at sentencing doesn’t have  to register. This kind of discharge means the person isn’t convicted even if  they are found guilty. Anyone who is pardoned is deleted from the registry.  Anyone who gets a “record suspension” (where their record is taken out of the  criminal record database) doesn’t have to keep reporting. In each of these situations,  officials can look at a person’s case on an individual basis to decide what  kind of risk they are to the public. But  none of these options were available to people like G who were found not  criminally responsible. Those people had no way of getting off the registry.  They had to report to police at least once a year no matter what. This was true  even if they got an absolute discharge, like G did. G  said this was discriminatory. He said it breached sections 7 and 15(1) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  part of Canada’s Constitution. Section 7 protects everyone’s right to life,  liberty, and security of person. Section 15(1) says everyone has the right to  be treated equally. The  judge who heard the <em>Charter </em>application  said G’s rights weren’t breached. The Court of Appeal agreed that his section  7 rights weren’t breached. But it said his section 15 rights were.      All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that G’s section 15 right to be  treated equally and without discrimination was breached. They all pointed out  many people wrongly think those with mental disabilities are always, and by  nature, dangerous. The majority said Ontario’s sex offender  registry law was discriminatory under section 15. This was because it didn’t  provide a way for people found not criminally responsible to get off the list  or to not have to report anymore. People who were found guilty had ways to do  this. This discriminated against people like G based on mental disability. (The  majority didn’t need to look at section 7 because it already found a <em>Charter </em>breach under section 15.) When a court  finds that a law violates the Constitution, the next question is the proper  “remedy,” or how to make it right. The majority set out principles for courts to  use when deciding remedies in these kinds of cases. In this case, the majority  said that the Court of Appeal was right that the part of Ontario’s law that  discriminated against G was invalid. It also said that the Court of Appeal was  right to give Ontario a year to fix the problem. When deciding whether to give  governments time to fix an unconstitutional law, the majority said courts should  look at the whole situation.  The majority  also said that the Court of Appeal was right to delete G from the registry. It  said the Court of Appeal was right to exempt him from having to keep reporting even  though it gave the government time to fix the law. This was because G, like  others who bring successful <em>Charter </em>cases,  help the public by uncovering unconstitutional laws. Giving governments time to fix unconstitutional laws should be rare. The  Supreme Court has not done this since <em><a href=""https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14637/index.do"">Carter  v. Canada (Attorney General)</a></em>, over five years ago."
2020 SCC 37,"<strong>Hydro-Québec could rely on permissions given in the decades before to  build a new transmission line on people’s land, the Supreme Court has  unanimously ruled.</strong>
   In  recent years, Hydro-Québec worked to modernize its electricity system. In  particular, it wanted to make Montreal’s access to power more reliable. It also  wanted to make sure there was enough electricity to meet people’s needs in  Terrebonne.  To  do this, it needed to build a new transmission line. Transmission lines move  high-voltage electricity over long distances. (The voltage gets lowered before  it moves to regular power lines closer to where it will be used.) These kinds  of lines have thicker cables and are held up by tall metal towers.  Building  the transmission line would mean crossing parts of people’s property. Hydro-Québec  realized it would be easiest to put the transmission line somewhere it already  had permission to.  Under  Quebec’s civil law rules, a “servitude” is a kind of permission to use someone  else’s property for a specific purpose. It’s like an “easement” in the common  law rules found in other provinces. Both servitudes and easements are recorded  in the land registration system. Hydro-Québec  had close to 40,000 different servitudes on people’s property. Many of these  servitudes were very old. The servitudes that Hydro-Québec wanted to use to  build the transmission line were from the 1970s. It originally got them through  “expropriation” to build another transmission line. Expropriation is when  government takes property, or some kind of right in that property, from owners.  Owners usually get compensation when this happens. After the expropriation, Hydro-Québec  came to agreements with the people who owned the land at the time. The  agreements set out exactly what the permission was for, and how much  Hydro-Québec would pay the owners. A first transmission line was built  afterward. In  2016, Hydro-Québec started working on its new project. Workers went to the  properties that the transmission line would cross. They wanted to take  measurements and get the land ready to build. Ms. Matta and the other property  owners didn’t let them do this. The property owners said the servitudes Hydro-Québec  was relying on were only for the transmission line that was built in the 1970s.  They said Hydro-Québec wasn’t allowed to use those servitudes to build a new  line.  The  trial judge said Hydro-Québec could go ahead. The Court of Appeal said it  couldn’t, unless it got new servitudes. To get those, it could make new  agreements with the owners or follow the usual process for expropriation.  All  the judges at the Supreme Court said Hydro-Québec could go ahead. It said the  Court of Appeal made a few mistakes. The Court of Appeal relied on evidence the  parties didn’t talk about, which it shouldn’t have done. It also made an  incorrect statement that affected the outcome of the case. The  Court said the agreements between Hydro-Quebec and the property owners likely  best captured everyone’s understanding of what the servitudes covered. Servitudes  that are gotten through expropriation can be changed by contract if everyone  agrees. The agreements between Hydro-Québec and the owners were the documents  that should be relied on. The  Supreme Court added that higher courts have a limited role. They aren’t allowed  to change a lower court’s decision on the nature of an agreement simply because  they disagree with it. They can only step in if there is a major and obvious  mistake. In this case, there was none. The trial judge was right to say that  the agreements reflected the permissions given by the servitudes. He was also  right to say that these permissions let Hydro-Québec build its new transmission  line on the owners’ land. Therefore, the Court of Appeal should not have  interfered with his decision. There are different  legal rules for when higher courts can or can’t step in. These are called  “standards of appellate review.” Higher courts can step in more easily if the  judge makes a mistake that’s only about the law. They can’t easily do this if  it’s a mistake about the facts or a combination of the law and the facts."
2020 SCC 35,"<strong>Maple Leaf Foods wasn’t responsible for the lost profits of Mr. Sub  owners due to a food recall, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Mr.  Sub was a chain of Canadian sandwich shops. It was a “franchise.” This meant  each shop was owned by different “franchisees.” As franchisees, shop owners had  the benefit of Mr. Sub’s brand. They also got better prices for supplies. Franchisees  usually have to use specific products and do things a specific way. This is so  the customer’s experience is always the same. As part of Mr. Sub’s franchise  agreement, its franchisees agreed to buy most of their sandwich meats from  Maple Leaf Foods. In  2008, Maple Leaf Foods learned that some of its meat contained a bacteria  called listeria. There was a lot of news coverage about people getting sick and  dying from eating Maple Leaf meats. No one got sick or died from eating meat at  a Mr. Sub. Anyone who bought the meat from Maple Leaf had to return it to be  destroyed, or throw it away, and would get a refund. Two of the meats affected  by the recall were used by Mr. Sub shops.  Right after the listeria outbreak, shop owners weren’t  allowed to buy meats from somewhere else. This was because the franchise  agreement with Mr. Sub said they couldn’t. After about two months, Mr. Sub said  the shop owners could buy from other companies. But before this, the individual  shops lost money. Their reputations were hurt. This was because people knew  they used Maple Leaf products, and they knew about the listeria contamination.  The shop owners could have asked Mr. Sub for permission to buy meat from  another company during this time, but they didn’t. The  shop owners sued Maple Leaf Foods. They couldn’t sue Mr. Sub because the  franchise agreement said they couldn’t. They said Maple Leaf was responsible  for their lost sales, profits, business value, and customer goodwill because of  the recall. The motion judge said Maple Leaf was responsible for  the shop owners’ losses. The Court of Appeal said it wasn’t.  The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court said Maple Leaf Foods didn’t owe the shop  owners for the money they lost or the damage to their reputation.  For  Maple Leaf Foods to be legally responsible, the shop owners would have to show  that it owed them a “duty of care.” In law, a duty of care means someone  has to act reasonably to avoid hurting others close to them. It is an important  concept in tort law. Tort law deals with non-criminal wrongdoing outside of a  contract.  Tort law isn’t about contracts. But one way courts can decide if someone is  close enough to owe someone else a duty is if there is a contract between them.  The  shop owners didn’t have a contract with Maple Leaf Foods. They had a contract  with Mr. Sub. The contract with Mr. Sub said they had to buy meat from Maple  Leaf. But Maple Leaf wasn’t part of that contract. Contracts are only between  the parties who agree to them. Maple Leaf didn’t have a contract with any of  the shop owners saying it <em>had </em>to  supply the meat to them. The shop owners said Maple Leaf Foods had to provide meat that was fit to  eat. They said it was responsible for their losses because it didn’t. When a claim  is only for lost profits, sales, value, or goodwill, it is a claim for “pure  economic loss.” This is a loss that doesn’t involve mental or physical damage  to someone or something. Claims for pure economic loss are allowed in very  specific situations. For example, it can be allowed so someone can avoid injury  when someone else builds or supplies something dangerous. The majority said  Maple Leaf’s duty was to protect customers from getting sick from eating their  meats, not to protect shop owners’ business interests. While it was responsible  for removing the danger (by recalling the meat), it wasn’t responsible for the shop  owners’ lost profits, sales, value, or goodwill. This case was a  “class action.” When a large group of people have the same legal problem, they  might decide to get together and sue as a group. The “class” is the group, and  the “action” is the lawsuit. That means a class action is a group lawsuit. It  lets the whole group get their complaint dealt with at once. In this case, 1688782  Ontario Inc. was the plaintiff who represented the group."
2020 SCC 32,"<strong>The </strong><em><strong>Charter </strong></em><strong>only protects human  beings—not corporations—from cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   9147-0732  Québec inc. was a corporation. It was found guilty of doing construction work  without a licence. Quebec’s <em>Building Act</em> set out a minimum fine as punishment. It was fined over $30,000. The corporation  said that the minimum fine was cruel and unusual punishment. It said this made  the fine unconstitutional.      The <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> sets  out the rights and freedoms that Canadians have. It is part of Canada’s  Constitution. Section 12 says that everyone has  the right “not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or  punishment.” This means certain treatments or punishments  are unacceptable and not allowed.  A  corporation is a “legal person.” A legal person is treated like a physical  person (a human being) for some purposes under the law. It has its own “legal  personality,” meaning it has its own rights and duties. For example, it can  sign contracts and own property, just like a human being can.  Corporations  can benefit from some <em>Charter </em>rights.  For example, corporations are protected against “unreasonable search and  seizure” under section 8. The state can’t search or take something  private from a corporation without permission, unless the law specifically  allows it, like when police have a warrant. Corporations also have the right to  a criminal trial in a reasonable time under section 11(b). However, they don’t  get the benefit of all <em>Charter </em>rights.  Corporations don’t have a right to “life, liberty and security of the person”  under section 7. They also don’t have a right not to be forced to testify under  section 11(c). The question in this case was whether a corporation could be  protected from cruel and unusual punishment under section 12. The trial judge at the Court of Quebec said the fine wasn’t cruel and  unusual. Anyway, he said, section 12only  protects human beings, not corporations. The first appeal judge, at the  Superior Court, agreed. The majority of judges at the Court of Appeal  disagreed, though. They said section 12 could apply to corporations. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that section 12 only protects people  (that is, real, live human beings). They said it doesn’t protect corporations. Cases  dealing with section 12 have focused on “human dignity.” Human dignity is the  idea that everyone has value and deserves respect, simply because they are a  human being. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they’ve done. The judges  pointed out that section 12 is meant to protect human dignity. Only human  beings can have human dignity. Corporations can’t. The  majority noted that it didn’t matter that there were human beings behind the  corporation. There are always real human beings behind a legal person. Even  though they may be making decisions on its behalf, they still keep their own  separate, individual legal personality. Most  of the judges looked at the word “cruel” in the phrase “cruel and unusual  punishment.” They pointed out that this word would normally only describe  something that caused pain or suffering. That could only happen to a living  thing like a human being, not a legal person like a corporation. This supported  the idea that section 12 didn’t apply to corporations. The  majority of judges focused on the wording of the <em>Charter</em>, its goals, and its history in making their decision. They said  the wording of the <em>Charter </em>and past  Canadian court decisions made it clear that section 12 only applied to human  beings. The majority said they didn’t need to rely on international treaties or  laws or cases from other countries to help them decide. But they said  international treaties that Canada agreed to should matter more than ones that  it didn’t agree to. Section  12 falls under the part of the <em>Charter </em>that  deals with legal rights. Sections 7 to 14 protect people’s rights when they are dealing with the justice system. They  make sure people can trust it and that they are treated fairly, especially when  they are charged with a crime. They are based on a belief in the dignity and  worth of every human being."
2020 SCC 30,"<strong>A class action by investors against mutual fund  sellers and managers can go ahead, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
    Desjardins  Financial Services sold mutual funds and helped people with financial planning.  Desjardins Global Asset Management created and managed investments that people  could buy. Mr.  Asselin talked to a Desjardins financial planner. The financial planner  recommended he buy some investments. He bought them. The investments were  “capital-guaranteed,” meaning he wouldn’t lose any money. The representative  gave Mr. Asselin documents saying the investments would make money and weren’t  risky. In the end, he earned nothing. He did get his original investment back,  though. Mr.  Asselin said he only found out later that the investments were risky. He also said  they were managed in a risky way. Mr. Asselin said he wouldn’t have bought them  if he knew the risks. He argued that Desjardins Financial Services should have  told its financial planners about the risk, so they could tell their clients. Other  people were in the same position as him. Mr. Asselin decided to launch a “class  action” lawsuit on their behalf. He said Desjardins Financial Services was  directly responsible for the fact he didn’t make the money he expected. This  was because it didn’t give proper instructions to its financial planners and  other representatives. He said it was indirectly responsible for the  representatives passing on the bad information. He also said Desjardins  Financial Management was responsible because it created and managed the  investments. When a large group of people have the same legal  problem, they might decide to get together and sue as a group. This is called a  “class action” lawsuit. (The “class” is the group, so it’s a <em>group</em> action.) A class action lets the  whole group get their complaint dealt with at once. Otherwise, each person  would have to go to court on their own. A judge has to give permission for  (authorize) the class action to go ahead. In Quebec, the judge’s main goal is  to make sure the class action isn’t “frivolous” (has no chance of success). The motion judge said the class action couldn’t go  forward. The Court of Appeal said it could. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court mostly agreed  with the Court of Appeal. They said the motion judge went beyond making sure  the class action wasn’t frivolous. This was legally wrong at this point in the  process.  The majority didn’t make a decision about Mr.  Asselin’s claim. It only said he could have his day in court. The majority agreed with Mr. Asselin that Desjardins  Financial Services had a “duty to inform” people about the risks. The majority  said a trial judge might eventually hold it responsible directly (for not  giving its representatives the information) and indirectly (through the  representatives acting on its behalf). However, a trial judge would decide that  later.  The majority said a trial judge might eventually  hold Desjardins Global Asset Management responsible for how it designed and  managed the investments. It might not be responsible for everything, though. Part  of the class action asking for “punitive damages” (which aren’t meant to  compensate victims, but to punish wrongdoers) wouldn’t go forward. The trial  judge would have to decide what this covered.    Class actions are based on people having the same  legal issues. This means the court has to deal with “common questions”  (questions that are the same for many or all members of the group). But people  may also have individual issues and questions. In Quebec, as long as there is  one common question that pushes the class action forward, that’s enough. In  this case, a common question was whether Desjardins Financial Services didn’t  properly inform its representatives, who then failed to tell clients about the  risks. It wasn’t about a particular financial adviser who made a mistake. All  the financial advisers may have made the same mistake if they weren’t trained  properly or given the right information.   Class actions are  meant to help people get access to justice. This can be easier to do as a group  instead of individually. When a class action is authorized, judges aren’t  supposed to look at whether the case will be successful. They are just supposed  to look at whether it has a chance of success. Different provinces and  territories have different rules, but the goals are the same. The Court  previously dealt with class actions in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2020/38521-eng.aspx"">Atlantic  Lottery Corporation Inc. v. Babstock</a></em>, <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37809-37810-eng.aspx"">Pioneer  Corp. v.

2020 SCC 29,"<strong>A binding agreement will exist where both sides  show by their actions they meant to enter an agreement, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>
     Crystal Square was a large complex in Burnaby, BC. It had  a mall, office tower, residential tower, hotel, parking garage, police office,  and cultural centre. Each was in a different “air space parcel.” Air space  parcels are parts within a whole. They can be separate buildings, or parts of a  building (like specific floors in a large tower). Legally, air space parcels  are separate. But they can share certain parts of the building or services. For  example, access to the street or connections for water or electricity. When Crystal Square was built,  its developer signed an Air Space Parcel Agreement with the City of Burnaby.  One thing the agreement set out was access to parking for each air space parcel  and how much they would pay for it. The office tower was a strata (condo) tower. A strata  is made up of several units or “strata lots.” Strata lots are owned by  different people, but have shared areas. Each strata lot owner is a member of a  strata corporation. The corporation manages and maintains shared areas and services.  A strata corporation is considered a legal person. That means it can sign  contracts and own property, just like a physical person can. The strata  corporation didn’t exist yet when the Air Space Parcel Agreement was signed. But  the members of the strata corporation still used the parking garage and paid  for it like the agreement said. Eventually, the owners felt that the parking cost was  too high. They realized they never formally signed the Air Space Parcel Agreement.  They said they didn’t agree to the terms and it didn’t apply to them. Crystal Square Parking owned and ran the parking  garage. It said the strata corporation accepted the agreement by following the  terms for a while.  The trial judge said the strata  corporation didn’t sign any agreement. She said the agreement between the  developer and the city couldn’t be enforced against the corporation. The Court  of Appeal said the strata corporation made a new agreement about parking. The  new agreement had the same terms as the one between the developer and the city.  The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed with the Court of  Appeal. They said the strata corporation made a new agreement with Crystal  Square Parking, and that it could be enforced. They said the new agreement had  the same terms that were in the Air Space Parcel Agreement. The  Court used the usual rules of contract law to decide this case. There was no  law in BC that would change the way the rules applied to a strata corporation.  It was clear the owners couldn’t be forced to follow the original Air Space  Parcel Agreement. Contracts are only between the parties who agree to them. Two  people can’t sign a contract to force another person, who didn’t agree, to do  something. This is called “privity of contract.” (“Privity” comes from the same  Latin word that “private” does, and contracts are private agreements.) Some  companies can “adopt” contracts that were agreed to before they existed, but  that didn’t apply here. The majority said the strata corporation made and  accepted a new agreement, though. The owners had to follow that.<br/>
     Generally,  contracts don’t have to be in writing. That just makes the terms easier to  prove. If it’s not clear that there is an agreement, or exactly what was agreed  to, courts look at actions. If both sides showed they meant to enter an  agreement, and acted in a way that led the other side to expect they would  follow through, then there is a contract. In this case, Crystal Square Parking made  parking passes available to the strata owners. The owners used the parking  spots and paid the fees that the original Air Space Parcel Agreement set out. In  this situation, there was no reason for Crystal Square Parking to think the strata  owners <em>didn’t </em>agree to the terms.
  This case was decided based on  common law contract rules (that is, rules about contracts developed by judges).  Legislatures can change these rules by passing laws, but no written laws  (statutes) applied to strata corporations in this particular case. The Supreme  Court of Canada has dealt with many different kinds of contract issues before.  For example, in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/37546-eng.aspx"">Moore v. Sweet</a></em>,  it said a verbal agreement about who got insurance money was valid. "
2020 SCC 28,"<strong>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police pension plan  discriminates against women, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Ms. Fraser, Ms. Pilgrim, and Ms. Fox were Royal Canadian Mounted Police  (RCMP) officers. They all had children in the 1990s. When they went back to  work, they found it hard to juggle work with their childcare responsibilities.  The RCMP wouldn’t let them work part-time. Ms. Fox retired and Ms. Fraser and  Ms. Pilgrim took more unpaid leave. In  December 1997, the RCMP began to allow job-sharing as an option instead of unpaid  leave. This way, two or three people could split the duties of one full-time  position. It was for the benefit of both the employees and the RCMP. The three  women joined the program and came back to work. Most people who joined the  program were women with children. Most did so to balance work with their  childcare responsibilities. Members of  the RCMP pay into a pension plan, and get a pension when they retire. Their  pension gets bigger the longer they work and the more money they earn.  Full-time members could “buy back” pension credit if they were suspended from  duty or took unpaid leave. This would make their pension bigger. But if they  job-shared, they weren’t allowed to buy back any pension credit. Job-sharers  said the situation was unfair. An expert said the RCMP could change the pension  plan to let the job-sharers buy back pension credit. An RCMP committee agreed  that job-sharers should be allowed to buy it back. The RCMP still didn’t let  them. Ms.  Fraser, Ms. Fox, and Ms. Pilgrim said they should be allowed to buy back the  pension credit. They said the pension plan treated job-sharers (who were mostly  women with children) worse than other members. They said this breached section  15(1) the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em>, part of Canada’s Constitution. Section 15(1) says the law should  treat everyone equally, without discrimination on certain characteristics.  The judge  who heard the <em>Charter </em>application  said there was no breach of section 15(1). She said if they were disadvantaged,  it wasn’t because they were women or the fact that they had kids. It was  because of their own choices. The Court of Appeal agreed. The majority  of judges at the Supreme Court disagreed with the lower courts. They said the  pension plan discriminated against the job-sharers because they were women. The <em>Charter </em>protects certain groups that  share specific characteristics (for example, their race or religion). The law  isn’t allowed to discriminate against people based on these “protected”  characteristics. To decide if equality rights have been breached under section  15(1), courts first look at whether a protected group is singled out by the law  somehow. Laws that seem neutral may still discriminate against members of  protected groups by affecting them differently. Members of the group don’t have  to show that the protected characteristic somehow <em>caused</em> the group to be more affected. It also doesn’t matter if all  members of the group are affected in the same way. Next, courts look at whether  the law maintains any kind of disadvantage to the group, or makes it worse. The  majority noted that many attitudes and policies had disadvantaged women in the past.  While many things have changed, rules like those in the pension plan can build  on those past harms.  In this  case, the majority said the pension plan breached the job-sharers’ right to  equality. This was because it disadvantaged women more than men. It didn’t  matter that the plan didn’t set out to hurt women in particular. What mattered  was its effect. The job-sharers were mostly women who were job-sharing because  they needed to care for their children. This maintained the disadvantage caused  by the long-standing expectation that women should be responsible for  childcare. The pension plan didn’t allow them to buy back credit like other  people could. The women were in this situation because they had to job-share to  take care of their kids. The majority said the job-sharers should be  able to buy back all their pension credit.  The  Court previously looked at ways women were disadvantaged at work in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/37002-eng.aspx"">Centrale des  syndicats du Québec v. Quebec (Attorney General)</a></em> and <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/37347-eng.aspx"">Quebec (Attorney  General) v.

2020 SCC 26,"<strong>An employee forced by their employer to quit should get a bonus they  would have received during the notice period, unless their contract says  otherwise, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Mr.  Matthews was a chemist. He worked for Ocean Nutrition. He helped make the  company successful in making omega-3 products. His job was important to him.  In  2007, Ocean Nutrition hired a new Chief Operating Officer. The Chief Operating Officer  and Mr. Matthews did not get along. He took responsibilities and team members  away from Mr. Matthews. This left Mr. Matthews with much less to do. The Chief Operating  Officer also lied to him. This upset Mr. Matthews. In 2010, Ocean Nutrition put  Mr. Matthews under review. This meant he might lose his job. The Chief  Operating Officer told the Board of Directors that there was no place for Mr.  Matthews at the company. This upset Mr. Matthews even more.  Mr.  Matthews suspected that Ocean Nutrition was going to be sold. As part of his  contract, Mr. Matthews would get a large bonus payment if this happened. This  was part of the reason he stayed with the company for so long, even after the  problems started. But eventually he found himself in an impossible situation,  so he quit. Just  over a year later, Ocean Nutrition was sold for over half a billion dollars.  Because Mr. Matthews didn’t work there anymore, the company said it didn’t owe  him the bonus payment. Mr. Matthews said he would have still been working there  if Ocean Nutrition didn’t “constructively dismiss” him. “Constructive  dismissal” is when an employer forces an employee out by making things so bad  that they quit, instead of firing them. Mr. Matthews said the company owed him the  bonus payment. The trial judge said that Mr. Matthews was  constructively dismissed. He said Mr. Matthews should get 15 months of “reasonable  notice.” The law says someone who is dismissed (“constructively” or not) should  get “reasonable notice” of the dismissal. “Notice” is a specific amount of time  the employee gets between the date when the employer tells them the contract  will end and when it ends. Sometimes the employee will keep working during the  notice period. But sometimes the employer just pays them what they would have  been paid if they had worked the time. Either way, they still count as an  “employee” during the notice period. The trial judge said Mr. Matthews would  have received the bonus payment if he was still working at Ocean Nutrition. He  said Mr. Matthews should still get it since Ocean Nutrition was sold during the  reasonable notice period. The bonus was about $1 million.  The  majority at the Court of Appeal agreed that Mr. Matthews was constructively  dismissed. It agreed that the notice period should be 15 months. But it said he  didn’t have a right to the bonus after he left the company. By  the time the case got to the Supreme Court of Canada, everyone agreed that Mr.  Matthews was forced to quit. Everyone agreed that he should have received 15  months’ notice. They disagreed on whether he should get the bonus payment as  part of his reasonable notice. They also disagreed on whether Ocean Nutrition  lied to him, and whether this meant he should get the bonus. All  the judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed that Mr. Matthews should get  the bonus payment. They said that the reasonable notice period should be 15  months, like the trial judge said. They said Mr. Matthews should get  compensation because he didn’t get notice. The Court said the compensation should  include the bonus payment. This was because the company was sold, and the bonus  payment triggered, during the notice period. There was nothing in Mr. Matthews’  contract that said he shouldn’t get it in this situation.  The Court also noted that Ocean Nutrition wasn’t honest  with Mr. Matthews about his future with the company. This was separate from  constructively dismissing him without notice. Mr. Matthews didn’t get extra  compensation for this, though. This was because he only asked for the bonus,  which he already got as part of reasonable notice.  The Court dealt with  whether people might be employees in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2020/38534-eng.aspx"">Uber v.

2020 SCC 25,"<strong>A company couldn’t make a bankrupt company it had a  contract with pay a penalty just because of the bankruptcy, the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>
   When a company can’t pay all of its bills, it can file  for bankruptcy. When this happens, everything it owns is given to a “trustee.”  The trustee decides how to divide everything among the people the company owes  money to. The rules for doing this are set out in the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>, a federal law. Chandos Construction signed a contract with Capital  Steel. It was worth almost $1.4 million. Part of the contract said Chandos  would get money if Capital Steel went bankrupt. The contract would be frozen  and Capital Steel would have to pay Chandos for anything it lost, plus extra  for overhead and profit. The contract also said Capital Steel would have to pay  Chandos 10% of the contract price (that is, about $140,000) for the  inconvenience. Capital Steel went bankrupt. At the time, Chandos owed  Capital Steel about $150,000 on the contract. But it said Capital Steel actually <em>owed it</em> over $10,000. This was  because of the costs and the 10% inconvenience fee that the contract said  Capital Steel had to pay if it went bankrupt. This added up to more than was  left on the contract. The trustee asked the court if  this was allowed. The application judge said yes. The majority of the Court of  Appeal said no. This was because it broke the “anti-deprivation rule.” The anti-deprivation rule says any part of a  contract that takes away (that is, <em>deprives</em> the trustee of) some of what the bankrupt company owns isn’t allowed.  The majority of judges at the Supreme Court agreed with  the Court of Appeal. They said there are two reasons why part of a contract  might be found invalid during a bankruptcy. The first is where the contract  gives some people who are owed money more than their fair share, so they get  bigger slices of the pie than they deserve. This is called the “<em>pari passu</em> rule.” The second is when part  of the pie is taken away so the whole pie is shrunk before it can even be  sliced. This is the situation covered by the anti-deprivation rule. The  majority said that the anti-deprivation rule had been part of Canadian law  since the 1870s. It was part of “common law,” not legislation. Common law is  law made by courts when there is no legislation (laws passed by Parliament or  legislatures). It can also help interpret and apply legislation. Common law  can’t go against legislation. It is just there to fill in the gaps, keeping  with the spirit of what Parliament or the legislature wanted. Legislation can  change common law, though. But in this case, the majority said the common law  was never changed, even by the <em>Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act</em>.  The  majority said the Act’s purpose was to make sure the trustee had as much as  possible to give to people who were owed money. The anti-deprivation rule helps  make sure this happens. It stops people from writing contracts to get around  the rules in the Act.  When deciding if something broke the anti-deprivation rule, the majority  said that courts should look at its effect. They shouldn’t look at what the  parties wanted, or said they wanted, at the time they came to an agreement. First,  it would be hard to know or prove what people wanted if a contract was signed a  long time ago. Second, a contract could still have the effect of hurting others  who were owed money, even if no one meant for that to happen. This would still  be wrong.  However, the  majority said the anti-deprivation rule might not be broken where someone  agreed to give up physical property (not money). Agreeing to get insurance, or  a putting up money (security) as a guarantee for the contract, might also be  allowed. The majority said that Chandos wasn’t allowed to reduce what it owed to  Capital Steel by deducting the inconvenience fee amounts. Capital Steel didn’t  actually owe Chandos any money, so there was nothing to deduct.  Bankruptcy is a  complicated process, and often involves many companies, people, and issues. The  Court previously dealt with bankruptcy’s effect on companies’ environmental  obligations in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37627-eng.aspx"">Orphan Well  Association v. Grant Thornton Ltd.</a></em> and <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37985-eng.aspx"">Resolute FP  Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Attorney General)</a></em>. It dealt with  bankruptcy’s effect on shareholders in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/37566-eng.aspx"">Brunette v.  Legault Joly Thiffault</a></em>."
2020 SCC 24,"<strong>British Columbia law says courts can order back child support even after  the child is grown up, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Ms.  Michel and Mr. Graydon were “common-law” spouses. This meant the law considered  them married, even if they didn’t have a marriage certificate. They lived in  British Columbia. They had a child, AG. A few years later, the relationship  ended. AG went to live with Ms. Michel. Mr. Graydon said his income was about  $40,000 a year. He agreed to pay about $340 a month in child support based on  that. While  AG was growing up, Ms. Michel lived on social assistance. Because of this, she  had to sign over her rights to child support to the government. The government  would collect the child support and pay her social assistance. The government  never tried to ask for more support for AG. When  AG became an adult, the child support ended. But Ms. Michel found out that Mr.  Graydon’s income had been higher than he said. She asked for back (retroactive)  child support based on his real income.     Mr.  Graydon said it was too late to ask for this. He said the court didn’t have the  power to make him pay now, because AG wasn’t a child anymore. When  parents are formally married and decide to get divorced, the <em>Divorce Act </em>applies. The <em>Divorce Act</em> is a federal law. But before  someone files for divorce, or when parents are <em>de facto</em> spouses (in Quebec) or common-law spouses (in other  provinces), provincial laws apply. Under the federal <em>Divorce Act</em>, if the child is now grown up, parents don’t have to  pay back child support even if they should have paid it earlier. Mr. Graydon said  British Columbia’s <em>Family Law Act</em> should be read the same way.      The  trial judge said Mr. Graydon hid his real income, and this hurt AG. He was to  blame for the situation. The trial judge ordered Mr. Graydon to pay $23,000 in  back child support, split between Ms. Michel and AG. But the appeal judges  agreed with Mr. Graydon that it was too late to order back child support. All  the judges at the Supreme Court of Canada said Mr. Graydon had to pay. They  said that courts could change past child support orders under the <em>Family Law Act</em>. They could do this even  if the child was now grown up. Child  support is a right that belongs to the child. The parents can’t negotiate it  away. It should give the child the same standard of living they had when their  parents were together. All the judges agreed that back payments are fair. Parents  are always responsible for paying according to their income. Back payment  orders just hold them to that.  All  the judges said courts need to consider the entire situation in deciding  whether to make a parent pay retroactive child support. This includes why a  parent waited to ask for the support, the behaviour of the parent who was  supposed to pay, the child’s situation, and whether it would cause hardship. The  majority said the reason Ms. Michel waited to ask for back payments was that  she had been badly hurt and the government took over her right to support. Mr.  Graydon knew his income was higher than he was saying, so it wouldn’t have been  a surprise to him that he had to pay more. He also knew how bad AG’s living  situation was because of lack of money, and instead of helping her, made  hurtful comments about it. He could afford to pay it now. All of this meant that  he had to pay. All  the judges agreed that preventing retroactive child support hurt women most.  They said that support should be limited only where the law clearly says so. They  said that although an older version of the law might have prevented child support  for the past, the current one didn’t. In any case, it would be wrong to  encourage people to avoid paying in case the other parent might wait too long  to ask for it. People shouldn’t be able to profit from acting badly. This case was  decided “from the bench” at the end of the hearing on November 14, 2019. When a  case is decided from the bench, it means the judges tell the parties the  outcome right away. In this case, the judges gave written reasons later to  explain."
2020 SCC 23,"<strong>A doctor’s defamation lawsuit against a lawyer  wasn’t meant to silence anyone, and could go forward, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>
     Freedom of expression is important to democracy, but  it has limits. One limit is defamation. Defamation law protects a person’s  reputation from unfair harm. Ms. Bent was a lawyer. She had been elected as  president of the Ontario Trial Lawyers Association (OTLA), whose members represented  people hurt in car accidents. Dr. Platnick was a doctor. He was hired by insurance  companies to look at reports written by other medical professionals. He would write  final reports giving medical opinions on how badly people were hurt. In 2014, Ms. Bent sent an email to the OTLA mailing  list. She said that Dr. Platnick had misrepresented and changed other doctors’  reports to make her clients’ injuries look less serious. This meant the people  who were hurt would get fewer insurance benefits.  Emails sent to the OTLA list were supposed to be confidential,  but someone shared the message about Dr. Platnick. An insurance industry  magazine published the full email in an article.  Dr. Platnick said Ms. Bent was wrong. He explained  that in one case he clearly made his own conclusions based on information from  other doctors who didn’t know Ontario’s accident benefits law. In another case,  a doctor made a mistake in a report and later fixed it. Dr. Platnick asked Ms. Bent to apologize. She didn’t,  so he sued her and her law firm for defamation (that is, for harming his  reputation). He asked for over $16 million in damages and lost income.  Ms. Bent said this was a “strategic lawsuit against  public participation,” or “SLAPP.” SLAPPs are lawsuits used to stop people from  speaking out on something that’s important to the public. SLAPPs aren’t about genuine  legal claims. They are about intimidating and silencing critics with the threat  of costing them time and money to defend the lawsuit. Like some other  provinces, Ontario has a law to stop SLAPPs before they ever go to trial. The motion judge agreed with Ms. Bent that the  defamation suit was a SLAPP and should be stopped. The Court of Appeal said it <em>wasn’t</em> a SLAPP and could go forward. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court said that Dr.  Platnick’s lawsuit wasn’t a SLAPP and should be allowed to continue. For his lawsuit to go forward, Dr. Platnick had to  show three things. First, that he had a likely chance of winning. Second, that  Ms. Bent had no valid defence. Third, he had to show that it was more important  to the public that his lawsuit be allowed to go forward than it was to protect  Ms. Bent’s expression.  The majority of judges said Dr. Platnick showed these  three things. They said that the motion judge made mistakes applying the law on  SLAPPs, about defamation law, and about the evidence. They said Dr. Platnick  had a likely chance of winning. This was because Ms. Bent’s email was sent to  670 OTLA members and talked about Dr. Platnick by name. It was also because Dr.  Platnick showed he lost about $600,000 in income because of the damage to his  reputation. Dr. Platnick also showed at this stage that there was a basis in  fact to find that Ms. Bent had no valid defence. The evidence showed that Dr.  Platnick may not have changed the doctor’s report. What Ms. Bent said wasn’t  necessarily true. Her comments also weren’t necessary because she didn’t have  to mention Dr. Platnick by name. Even if Ms. Bent thought the email list was  confidential, she talked to the magazine about it and let them publish it. The  majority of judges said that the email was a personal attack and that Ms. Bent  didn’t confront Dr. Platnick about anything before she sent it. They said the  harm to Dr. Platnick was more important to the public than protecting Ms.  Bent’s freedom of expression in this situation.  The majority said that just because a court says a  lawsuit isn’t a SLAPP and can go forward doesn’t mean it will succeed. This  just means the person deserves to have their day in court. In a trial, the court  will hear much more evidence and argument, and will have much more to base a  decision on.  <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2020/38376-eng.aspx"">1704604  Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association</a></em> was another  case about SLAPPs. The Court used its decision in that case and applied it to  this one. The Court heard the cases on the same day."
2020 SCC 22,"<strong>A land developer’s lawsuit against a residents’ group was meant to  silence critics and can’t go forward, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled.</strong>
   1704604 Ontario Ltd. was a land development company in  Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. It wanted to build a neighbourhood on an area that was  part of a wetland. Some local residents were against the plan. They said it  would destroy the wetland and cause other damage to the environment. They  formed a group called Pointes Protection. The company had to get permission to build the  neighbourhood. It needed approvals from the local Conservation Authority and  City Council.  The  Conservation Authority approved the plan. Pointes Protection said the decision  was wrong. It asked a court to review it. While this was happening, Council  said no to the plan. The company appealed Council’s decision to the Ontario  Municipal Board, which decides on planning disagreements. Pointes  Protection agreed not to go to court about the Conservation Authority decision.  It agreed not to say that the Conservation Authority’s decisions were against  the law or not allowed. The company lost at the Municipal Board hearing. During  the hearing, a Pointes Protection representative testified about the company’s  plan. He said the plan would hurt the environment and destroy part of the  wetland. The company said this went against the agreement. It sued for breach  of contract and asked for $6 million in damages. Pointes Protection said the company was wrongly trying  to stop residents from speaking out. It said the company was trying to silence  criticism on an important public issue. It said this was a “strategic lawsuit  against public participation,” or “SLAPP.” SLAPPs aren’t about genuine legal  claims. They are about intimidating and silencing critics. They are about  getting people to settle and stop speaking to avoid the time and money it would  cost to go to court. Like some other provinces, Ontario has a law to stop  SLAPPs before they ever go to trial. The  motion judge said the lawsuit wasn’t a SLAPP and it could go forward. The Court  of Appeal said it <em>was</em> a SLAPP, so it  had to be dismissed. All  the judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed this was a SLAPP. They said  that SLAPPs hurt people’s right to freedom of expression, and that freedom of  expression is important to our democracy. Ontario’s rules about SLAPPs were new, so the Court  had to decide how to apply them. For a lawsuit to be a SLAPP, it had to be  about something the defendant (the person being sued) communicated. Whatever it  was the defendant communicated had to be important to the public. But the  person suing (the plaintiff) could show the lawsuit <em>wasn’t</em> a SLAPP by showing three things. The first was that they  were likely to win. The second was that the person being sued had no valid defence.  The third was that it was more important to the public to let the lawsuit go  forward than to protect what the defendant said. The Court said judges have to  look at the whole situation, between the parties and in society, to decide  whether a lawsuit is really a SLAPP and should be stopped.      In  this case, the testimony at the Ontario Municipal Board was an expression  related to the public interest, as it was about the environmental impacts of  the company’s plan. The lawsuit was based on what the Pointes Protection representative  said in the testimony. The Court said that the company didn’t have much of a  chance of winning because its argument was based on an incorrect interpretation  of the agreement. Pointes Protection had agreed it wouldn’t raise their environmental  concerns to the Conservation Authority. However, nothing in the contract said  it couldn’t use the same evidence in a different situation. The Court also said it was more important to the  public to protect Pointes Protection’s testimony before an administrative  decision-maker than to prevent the harm the company said it experienced. This was the first  time the Supreme Court dealt with Ontario’s new rules about SLAPPs. Another  case, <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2020/38374-eng.aspx"">Bent v.  Platnick</a></em>, was also about SLAPPs. The Court used its decision in  this case and applied it to that one. The Court heard the cases on the same  day."
error:https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/cb/2020/38381-38459-eng.aspx,"<strong>A Cabinet document used to decide on judges’ pay in British Columbia  should stay confidential, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled. But parts of  one used in Nova Scotia should be disclosed.</strong>
   Under  the Constitution, Canada has three branches of state. The executive branch (the  Prime Minister or Premier and Cabinet) decides policy. The legislative branch  (Parliament or legislatures) makes laws. The judiciary (the courts) interprets  and applies laws. Each branch has a different role. It  is important for our democracy that each branch has some independence. For  courts, “judicial independence” means they can do their work without  interference from the other branches. For example, judges can only be removed  from office for very good reasons. This is so judges aren’t afraid to make the  right decisions, even unpopular ones. Also, only judges can decide how to  manage court processes. And judges must be paid properly, so financial pressure  can’t be used against them. Judges  can’t negotiate their salaries with the government. Negotiations would make the  issue political. This would upset the relationship between the branches.  Instead, independent commissions make salary recommendations to governments. Governments  have to formally respond and give reasons if they decide not to follow them. Only  the executive and the legislative branches can make decisions about judges’  salaries. But courts can still review these decisions. This is to make sure  governments are doing what they are supposed to under the Constitution. For  judges’ salaries, courts will look at whether there was a valid reason not to  follow a recommendation. They will look at whether the decision was based on  facts. And they will look at whether the government respected the commission’s  role and judicial independence. Commissions  in British Columbia and Nova Scotia made recommendations about salaries of  judges appointed by those provinces. The governments decided not to follow all the  recommendations. The associations representing the judges asked the courts to  review the governments’ decisions. As part of this, they asked the courts to  order the governments to give them copies of the confidential Cabinet documents  used to make the decisions. The  lower courts in both provinces said the governments had to disclose (share) the  Cabinet documents. All  the judges at the Supreme Court of Canada said the British Columbia Cabinet  document should stay confidential. But they said part of the Nova Scotia  document should be disclosed (shared). The  Court said confidential Cabinet documents could only be shared under certain  conditions. There had to be reason to believe the documents might help show  that the government didn’t follow its obligations. In such a case, a judge  would look at the documents, without anyone else seeing them. If the judge  decided the document would help show the government didn’t follow its  obligations, the judge could still decide not to release the documents. But  only if there was a good reason not to. For  example, the document could be protected by solicitor-client privilege, if it  dealt with legal advice to the government. The document could also be protected  by “public interest immunity.” This is when courts look at whether the public  interest in keeping Cabinet documents confidential outweighs the public interest  in knowing what was said. It  would depend on the situation. But it is important that ministers can have  frank discussions with their colleagues. They have to defend government  decisions publicly, even if they don’t agree with them personally. It’s part of  their job. If Cabinet discussions weren’t confidential, ministers could be  criticized for holding different private views than those they defended in  public. This could be a distraction and lower people’s confidence in  government. In  the British Columbia case, the Court said there was no reason to believe the  document might help show the government didn’t follow its obligations. But,  in the Nova Scotia case, the Court said there was reason to believe the document  might help show the government didn’t follow its obligations when it decided on  judges’ salaries. The Court looked at the Cabinet document. It confirmed parts  of it would help show the government didn’t follow some obligations. And the  Court said public interest immunity didn’t prevent those parts from being  shared. Courts have a  special role in society because they hold up the rule of law. The rule of law  is the principle that everyone should follow the same legal rules in society.  Under the Constitution, courts can’t be politicized. Otherwise, people could  lose faith in our justice system. This is why judicial independence is  important to all Canadians, not just judges."
2020 SCC 19,"<strong>A class action lawsuit about video lottery games can’t go forward, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>Video  lottery terminals (VLTs) are electronic gambling machines. They let people pay  to play gambling games, like slots, for fun or in hopes of winning money. They  are usually found in bars and places that sell alcohol. Any place that has a  VLT has to get a licence for it. In Newfoundland and Labrador, Atlantic Lottery  Corporation approves the licence. Mr.  Babstock played VLTs. He wanted to sue Atlantic Lottery Corporation. He said VLTs  were dangerous and that they tricked people. He said Atlantic Lottery  Corporation should have to pay six years’ worth of profits from VLTs in  Newfoundland and Labrador to the people who played them. Mr. Babstock wanted to  sue on behalf of all of these people. When a large group of people have the same legal problem, they might decide  to get together and sue as a group. This is called a “class action” lawsuit.  (The “class” is the group, so it’s a group action.) A class action lets the  whole group get their complaint dealt with in court at once. Otherwise, each  person would have to go to court on their own. A judge has to “certify” the  class action, to give it permission to go ahead. A “representative plaintiff” is  a person that represents the entire group. In this case, Mr. Babstock was the  representative plaintiff. He asked the court to certify the class action. Mr. Babstock said that Atlantic Lottery Corporation was negligent (that is,  it didn’t take proper care). He said it should have warned people about the  risks of gambling on VLTs. These risks included addiction and suicidal  thoughts. Mr. Babstock said this was wrong. He said Atlantic Lottery  Corporation should have to pay the group all the profits it made. He said it  had to do this even if no one showed any harm or loss. Mr. Babstock said that  this was a “waiver of tort.” He said it wasn’t just a way of <em>compensating</em> harm, but that it was the <em>basis</em> for that harm. Also, Mr. Babstock said that Atlantic Lottery Corporation broke a contract with  each person who paid to play. He said it should have provided games that were  safe. Instead, the games tricked people. This was a “breach of contract.”  Finally, he said Atlantic Lottery Corporation got a benefit at the group’s  expense that it didn’t have a legal right to. This was “unjust enrichment.”
     Both the certification judge and Court of Appeal said the class action could  go ahead. They said “waiver of tort” may be a basis someone could sue on, not  just a way of compensating for harm. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court said that none of Mr. Babstock’s  arguments had a chance of success. Because of this, they said the class action  shouldn’t go ahead.  All the judges agreed that “waiver of tort” doesn’t exist in Canadian law.  They said people could be compensated for harm through “disgorgement” but that  it couldn’t be the basis for harm. Disgorgement means giving up your profits  even if you didn’t cause anyone harm or loss.  The majority said that disgorgement could only be used as compensation in  very specific situations, like a broken contract. It could only be used if  other ways of compensating wouldn’t work. For example, if it isn’t possible to  calculate the amount of the loss, or if the loss can’t be expressed in money,  disgorgement might be an option. The majority said that wasn’t the case here. The majority said this wasn’t a case of “unjust enrichment” because there  was a contract, as Mr. Babstock admitted. Getting a benefit from a valid  contract is a legal reason to keep that benefit. Trials, especially class action  trials, take a lot of time and money. This is why judges have to make sure a  class action has a chance of success before saying it can go ahead. They don’t  look at all of the evidence to decide this. They just apply the law to decide  whether it would have a chance of success if all the claims were true."
2020 SCC 18,"<strong>A person’s right to trial within a reasonable time was breached because it  took over four and a half years for his trial to begin, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>
   The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights  and Freedoms </em>is part of Canada’s Constitution. Under section 11(b), anyone  charged with a crime has the right to be tried in a reasonable time. This right  protects both people accused of crimes and society. Long criminal trials cause  suffering and frustration for everyone involved. People accused of crimes often  sit in jail while waiting for their trial. Victims and their families are left  waiting for a final decision. The public waits longer to see justice done.  The  right to be tried in a reasonable time is important. If an accused person’s  trial takes too long, it can be stopped. This is called a “stay of  proceedings.” It means there won’t be a verdict of guilty or not guilty.  In  2016, the Supreme Court of Canada decided an important appeal, <em><a href=""https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16057/index.do"">R. v. Jordan</a></em>. <em>Jordan</em> set out rules  to decide how long is too long for a criminal trial. It said that most trials  should finish either 18 or 30 months after a person is charged, depending on  the type of trial. <em>Jordan </em>tells judges to “presume” (accept as true) that  anything longer is “unreasonable,” unless there is something unusual to justify  it. (In this context, “unreasonable” basically means “too long.”) If the time  taken was unreasonable, the proceedings have to be “stayed.” <em>Jordan</em> also set out  special rules for cases that had already started when the rules changed. These  were called “transitional” cases. Mr. Thanabalasingham was charged with second-degree murder of his spouse in  2012. Before the trial was  scheduled, the Crown (the prosecution) wanted to change the charge to  first-degree murder. The preliminary hearing (a hearing that sometimes happens  before a trial for serious crimes) took over a year. There were also other  delays. The trial was set for 2017, after <em>Jordan </em>was released. But just before it was going to start, Mr.  Thanabalasingham said his right to be tried in a reasonable time had been breached.  He asked for a stay of proceedings. The trial judge agreed and ordered the stay. A majority at the Court of  Appeal agreed. The Supreme Court  unanimously agreed that Mr. Thanabalasingham’s right to be tried in a  reasonable time was breached. It said the proceedings should be stayed. The delay in Mr.  Thanabalasingham’s case was at least 45 months, and he spent it waiting in jail.  This was much longer than the 30-month maximum set out in <em>Jordan. </em>The Court said it was open to the Crown to change the  charge to first-degree murder. But the Crown should have been aware that this  could cause delay, and the delay would affect Mr. Thanabalasingham’s right to  be tried in a reasonable time.  Most of the delay  in this case happened before <em>Jordan </em>was  decided. This was a “transitional” case, but that didn’t matter because it also  would have been stayed under the old rules. The Court said that, because of <em>Jordan</em>,  delays this bad probably wouldn’t happen again. Before<em> Jordan</em>, many people in the justice system just accepted long delays  as normal. <em>Jordan</em> said it shouldn’t  be this way. It sent the message that everyone in the justice system has a role  to play in making sure people get tried in a reasonable time. The Crown has to  be organized, share information with the defence without delay, and not waste court  time. The defence has to be ready to go ahead with the trial if the court and  the Crown are. Trial judges have to avoid delay where they can, even if it means  denying a defence request to postpone. This is because the right to a trial in  a reasonable time also benefits victims and society, too.  This case came to the  Supreme Court as an appeal “as of right.” This means that the person doesn’t  need the Court’s permission to appeal. There is an appeal as of right in  criminal cases when a Court of Appeal judge dissents (disagrees) on a point of  law, as happened here."
2020 SCC 17,"<strong>Parliament had the power to make it a crime to force someone to get  genetic testing or reveal their test results, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Genetic  testing looks at genetic material (like DNA) from a person’s body. It can find  out personal information, like what diseases a person might have, develop, or  pass on to their children. Parliament  passed the <em>Genetic Non-Discrimination Act </em>to make rules on genetic testing related to diseases. It made it a crime to  force someone to get that testing, or share their results, to sign a contract  or buy something. For example, insurance companies couldn’t make people get  tested to get life insurance coverage. Parliament also made it a crime to  collect, use, or share the results of someone’s genetic tests without their permission.  Anyone breaking the rules could be fined up to $1 million or put in jail for up  to five years, or both.  The  Government of Quebec didn’t think Parliament had the power to make these rules.  That’s because Canada’s Constitution gives different powers to the provinces  and the federal government. For example, Parliament (the branch of the federal  government responsible for making laws) has the power to make criminal laws. Provincial  legislatures (which make laws for each province) can make laws about property  and civil rights. This includes laws about buying and selling goods and  services. If a provincial legislature or Parliament passes a law that only the  other has the power to make, the law will be unconstitutional. The  Government of Quebec asked the Quebec Court of Appeal to decide if the rules  were unconstitutional. The Attorney General of Quebec said the rules were unconstitutional  because they were really about making rules for insurance and employment contracts and  promoting health, not about making criminal law. The Attorney  General of Canada agreed.  The  Attorneys General of Quebec and Canada both argued that the rules were  unconstitutional. To make sure it heard the other side of the argument, the  Court of Appeal appointed an “<em>amicus  curiae</em>” to argue that they were constitutional. “<em>Amicus curiae</em>” is a Latin term meaning “friend of the court.” It is  an independent lawyer a court asks to take part in a case. The <em>amicus curiae</em> said the rules were  meant to protect the security and dignity of vulnerable people, and to prevent  outcomes that would be morally wrong. He said this fell under Parliament’s  power to make criminal law. The  Court of Appeal agreed with the Attorneys General and said the rules were  unconstitutional. It said Parliament didn’t have the power to make the rules  because they were really about things under provincial power. The Court of  Appeal said the rules didn’t have anything to do with criminal law. The  Canadian Coalition for Genetic Fairness was an “intervener” when the Court of  Appeal heard the case. Interveners are people or groups who get the court’s  permission to give their point of view. They make arguments in writing. Some  are also allowed to make short arguments in person at the hearing. They help  judges see different angles and make better decisions. The Coalition said the  rules fell under Parliament’s power to make criminal law because they protected  people’s health, privacy, and equality. The Coalition appealed the Court of  Appeal’s decision to the Supreme Court. Most  of the judges at the Supreme Court said the rules were constitutional. Five  judges agreed that Parliament had the power to create the rules. They said the rules were  criminal law because they prohibited something and created punishments for  breaking the rules, and because the rules were trying to prevent certain kinds  of harm. They said this is what criminal law is meant to do. These  judges disagreed over what the rules were really about and the kinds of harm  they were meant to prevent. This case came to the Supreme Court as an appeal from a provincial  “reference.” References are questions that governments ask courts for their  opinion on. (In law, an “opinion” isn’t just a belief or point of view. It is a  formal explanation of the law.) The federal government can ask the Supreme  Court for a legal opinion on an issue. Provincial and territorial governments  can ask their Courts of Appeal for opinions, and these opinions can be appealed  to the Supreme Court. Appeals in references from Courts of Appeal don’t need  leave (permission) to be heard by the Supreme Court. This case began as a  reference to the Quebec Court of Appeal by the Quebec government."
2020 SCC 16,"<strong>An agreement saying an UberEats driver had to go to arbitration instead  of suing in Ontario was so unfair it was invalid, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>Uber  was a company that created software (phone apps) to arrange ride-sharing and  food delivery.  Mr.  Heller was a driver for UberEats, the food delivery service. To become a  driver, Mr. Heller had to click to agree to a long, standard contract. He  didn’t have any power to negotiate any of it. His only option was to accept or  reject it. The contract said any legal problem Mr. Heller had with the company had  to be resolved by the International Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands, not  a court. This part of a contract is called an “arbitration clause.” The  agreement meant Mr. Heller wasn’t allowed to sue the company in court. When  Mr. Heller clicked on the contract, he didn’t know how much arbitration would  cost. The contract didn’t say anything about this. He later found out that it  would cost him almost $15,000 (U.S. dollars) just to start the process. This  didn’t count legal fees, travel costs, or lost wages. Mr. Heller earned between  $400 and $600 (Canadian dollars) each week. This was before he paid taxes and  expenses. Starting the arbitration would cost most of his yearly income. In  2017, Mr. Heller said Uber was breaking the terms of the contract and Ontario  employment law. He decided to sue Uber. His lawsuit was about whether he and other  drivers were employees of the company. Uber  said Mr. Heller couldn’t sue in Ontario courts. This was because he had agreed  to go to arbitration. Mr.  Heller said the arbitration clause was “unconscionable” (so unfair it was  invalid). The  motion judge stayed (stopped) the lawsuit. He agreed with Uber that the  arbitrator should decide if the arbitration clause was unfair. The Court of  Appeal, on the other hand, agreed with Mr. Heller that Ontario courts should  decide whether the arbitration agreement was valid. The Court of Appeal decided  the agreement was invalid. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court agreed that courts should decide if the  arbitration clause was unfair. They also agreed that it was invalid. The  majority said Ontario’s <em>Arbitration Act </em>applied  in this situation. The Act said a lawsuit in court shouldn’t go forward in  court if both sides had agreed to arbitration, but there were exceptions. One  exception was if the agreement was invalid.  In  this case, the majority said upholding the arbitration agreement would deny Mr.  Heller access to a remedy (that is, a way to get compensated for harm or  wrongdoing). There would be no way he could even have his arguments heard  without paying most of his yearly income and likely having to go to the  Netherlands. He didn’t know any of this when he agreed to the contract. The  majority said this made the arbitration agreement unconscionable, so it was  invalid. Courts  use unconscionability to protect weaker parties in contracts with stronger  parties. When one party has no choice, or doesn’t understand what they are  signing, their bargaining power is weaker. Courts can set aside the agreement  if a stronger party gets too much of an advantage (even if it doesn’t mean to).  Because it found the arbitration  clause to be invalid for unconscionability, the majority didn’t need to decide  if it was also invalid for avoiding mandatory employment laws. The result meant  Mr. Heller could continue his lawsuit in Ontario courts. Arbitration  agreements are becoming more common in many contracts. The Supreme Court  previously dealt with Ontario arbitration laws in <em><a href=""../2019/37722-eng.aspx"">TELUS  Communications Inc. v. Wellman</a></em>.

2020 SCC 15,"<strong>The Supreme Court issued written reasons in a case  decided from the bench in November 2019.</strong>
   In 2009, Ms. Macht got a loan for $306,000 from TD  Bank. The loan was secured by a hypothec on her house. (A hypothec in Quebec’s  civil-law system is like a mortgage in common-law provinces and territories.)  She also got a loan of about $94,000 from the Youngs. It was also secured by a  second hypothec. The Youngs knew about the first hypothec with the bank.  Ms. Macht stopped paying her loans. If a hypothec  doesn’t get paid, the person owed money can force the property to be sold or  can take it themselves. The Youngs asked the Quebec court to force Ms. Macht to  give up the house in order to pay the debt she owed them. In 2011, the court  declared them the owners. But the bank still had its hypothec on the house. Shortly after, the bank asked the court to be allowed  to take the house from Ms. Macht because its hypothec wasn’t paid. But the  Youngs owned it now. They paid the bank what Ms. Macht owed in missed payments,  even though they didn’t agree they had to.  The bank asked the court to force  the Youngs to give up the house in order to pay Ms. Macht’s debt. The trial  judge agreed with the bank, and said it was the owner. The Court of Appeal  disagreed. It noted that the bank only took action against the Youngs, who  owned the house at the time. The bank didn’t take action against Ms. Macht, who  personally owed it the money. The Court of Appeal said the hypothec didn’t  exist anymore. It had expired even before the trial judge made his decision.  The bank should have taken action against Ms. Macht to stop it from expiring.  But the time had expired, so it was too late for it to do this and try to get  its money back from the Youngs.  The Supreme Court decided this case “from the bench” at  the end of the hearing on November 7, 2019.  When a case is decided “from the bench,” it means an  oral decision is given right away. The parties don’t have to wait for a written  decision, which takes some time (an average of about five months in 2019).  About a third of decisions were given from the bench in 2019. When a case is decided from the bench, the Court will  sometimes give a written explanation (reasons) later. This can be done to make  things more clear. In most cases, though, there won’t be written reasons. This  doesn’t mean there is no explanation. When giving the oral decision, the Court  might give a short explanation, or say something like, “we allow (or dismiss)  this appeal substantially for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal.” That  means it’s relying on the reasons of the lower court, which basically got it right. In this case, the majority of judges agreed completely  with the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal’s decision stayed in effect. That  meant the Youngs got to keep the house and the bank couldn’t claim anything on  it. Canada has two major  legal traditions, common law (based on English law) and civil law (based on the  French civil code). Quebec is the only province that applies civil law. It can  be found in the province’s <em>Civil  Code</em>, which applies to most non-criminal legal issues. Some concepts – like  mortgages and hypothecs – are similar under common law and civil law. But they  are often based on different principles and can have different rules. Having  two main legal traditions helps make Canada unique. In fact, the Supreme Court  of Canada is the only bilingual (two languages) and bijural (two legal systems)  supreme court in the world. "
2020 SCC 14,"<strong>To be found guilty of breaching bail conditions, people have to know  they are breaching them (or know they are seriously risking it), the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>
   When someone is charged with a  crime, they are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court. This is why someone  who is arrested should normally be freed on bail before their trial. A court  can put conditions on bail for limited reasons, including to protect the public.  Conditions are rules the person has to follow. Breaching a  bail condition is a crime. This is true even if the person isn’t found guilty  of the original charges. It’s true even if the act that makes up the breach (for  example, staying out too late) isn’t a crime itself and no one gets hurt. Mr. Zora was charged with drug crimes  and was out on bail. One of his bail conditions was that he had a curfew (he  had to be home at certain times). Another was that he had to come to the door  within five minutes if someone came to check that he was home. Two times, Mr.  Zora didn’t come to the door when police checked. He was charged for breaching  his bail conditions. Mr. Zora said he was home both times but didn’t hear the  door. The trial judge found him guilty of  not coming to the door. The summary conviction appeal judge and the Court of  Appeal agreed. This case was about the nature of  the crime of breaching a bail condition. To be guilty of a crime, a  person must <em>do</em> something that is against the (criminal) law.  This is called the “<em>actus reus</em>,” which means “guilty act” in Latin. (In  this case, the <em>actus reus</em> was not  coming to the door.) But something has to make the person <em>responsible</em> for  what they’ve done. This is called the “<em>mens rea</em>,” which means “guilty  mind” in Latin. For many crimes, a person is responsible if they intended,  knew, or were aware of what might happen. This is “subjective” <em>mens rea</em>. But for some crimes, a person  can be responsible even if they don’t mean to do anything wrong. This is “objective” <em>mens rea</em>. That is, courts look at whether  the accused person did something very different from what an ordinary, sensible  person would have done in the same situation. Courts across Canada disagreed  about the <em>mens rea</em> for breaching a  bail condition.  The Supreme Court of Canada was unanimous. All the judges said the <em>mens rea </em>for breaching a bail condition  was subjective. Courts had to look at what the person actually knew or was  aware might happen when deciding if they were guilty of a breach. Criminal law is based on the principle that a morally innocent person shouldn’t  be punished. That’s why courts assume the <em>mens  rea </em>for crimes is subjective<em>.</em> The  exception is if Parliament says something different in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Parliament didn’t say that here.  The Court said Parliament meant for the <em>mens  rea </em>for breaching bail conditions to be subjective. Being found guilty of a  breach can have serious effects on a person’s life. They can go to jail for up  to two years for each breach and are more likely to be denied bail in the  future. This especially affects vulnerable and marginalized people who can get  many charges because they can’t follow their conditions. Charging people for  breaching conditions isn’t the only way to prevent them from doing this. The crime  exists to stop people who know they are breaching their conditions, or know  they are risking it, and do so anyways. Parliament meant for courts to look at  the person’s situation when the breach happened.  The Court also said how bail conditions should be set. Normally there shouldn’t  be any conditions on bail. If there are conditions, there should be as few as  possible. They have to be clear, necessary, and match the risk of the  situation. Courts should be careful not to set bail conditions that a person can’t  meet.  In Mr. Zora’s case, the Court said there should be a new trial. The new  trial would decide if he knew he was breaching his bail conditions, or creating  a serious risk he would breach them. This was the first  time the Supreme Court of Canada looked at the <em>mens rea</em> for breach of bail conditions. The Court recently looked  at bail and pre-trial detention in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37869-eng.aspx"">R. v. Myers</a></em>. "
2020 SCC 13,"<strong>Children who study in English  or French should get the same quality of education, and eight B.C. communities  should get French-language schools, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
     The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em> is part of Canada’s Constitution. It sets out the rights and  freedoms of all Canadians. Some of those <em>Charter </em>rights protect the use of Canada’s official languages, English and French.  Section 23 of the <em>Charter </em>is about  the right to go to school in English or French, even when it’s not  the main language of the province or territory. It says people whose first  language is the minority language, or who went to primary school in that  language, can send their kids to school in that language. But there have to be  enough children in a community to justify it. Section 23 doesn’t say exactly  how many children is enough for different levels of services. (For example, their  own classrooms, their own schools, or their own school boards.) It also doesn’t  say how good the education in those schools has to be. The  Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique is B.C.’s  French-language school board. The school board and some parents said B.C.  hadn’t done enough for French-language schools in the past. It wanted the  government to fix school buildings and property and to build new schools  because the number of students was going up. It said the government’s laws and  policies breached the French-speaking community’s language rights under section  23. B.C. said there weren’t enough students for new schools and that the  existing schools were good enough. It also said it would cost too much to  provide all the services the school board wanted. The  trial judge said there were enough children for a school in some, but not all,  parts of B.C. By not providing those schools, B.C. breached the French-speaking  community’s rights under section 23. But she said this didn’t mean B.C. had to  build new schools right away. She said it had to pay $6 million in damages for  not funding school buses, though. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial  judge but said the government didn’t have to pay the $6 million. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada said the lower courts  interpreted section 23 of the <em>Charter</em> too narrowly. They said school helps preserve the language and culture of  official-language minorities. That’s why the right to go to school in the  minority language is protected. The  majority set out a way to decide what kinds of programs and services  minority-language students should get. In general, it said they should  get their own school if the government gave one to the same number of  majority-language speakers somewhere in the province. This would promote  fairness and make sure public funds are spent wisely. In B.C., it means that  there were enough students to justify eight new French-language schools. They  said a trial court should decide about one more school. The  majority also said all children deserve the same opportunities. That means that  minority- and majority-language students should get the same quality and  experience at school. Going to a small school shouldn’t mean students get a  worse education. Under section 1 of the <em>Charter</em>,  certain rights can be limited. But this is only if the limit is reasonable and  can be justified in a free and democratic society. The majority said it would  be very difficult to justify a limit for section 23. Section 23 is already  limited because the right depends on there being enough students. Plus, it  requires the government to spend money on schools.  So the majority said that saving money wasn’t  a good enough reason to justify breaching section 23. The majority also said governments can’t avoid paying damages for decisions  based on their policies. This is in order to ensure they respect people’s  rights. That meant B.C. had to pay the $6 million for not funding school buses. It also had to pay $1.1 million  because it hadn’t given the school board enough money for rural schools. This was one of two cases heard during the Supreme Court’s <a href=""/court-cour/events-evenements/winnipeg/index-eng.aspx"">visit  to Winnipeg</a>, Manitoba in September 2019. It was the first time in  history the Court sat outside of Ottawa. "
2020 SCC 11,"<strong>Police need good reason to suspect someone answering a  phone (or the number itself) is involved in drug dealing before asking them to sell  drugs, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Police can investigate crime in different ways. To find  out about crimes that are hard to investigate (like drug trafficking, child  luring, or terrorism), they may have to tempt people to commit them. But there  are limits to this. They have to be able to show the court that they had a “reasonable  suspicion” (a good reason to suspect) that a certain crime was happening. Needing  reasonable suspicion makes sure courts can review police actions to check they  are acting properly.  If police don’t have a reasonable suspicion and they  tempt a person to commit a crime anyway, it is called “entrapment.” Entrapment  is very serious. It undermines society’s sense of justice and the rule of law. When  it happens, there has to be a “stay of proceedings.” That means the prosecution  must be stopped and the person can’t be convicted of the crime.  This decision dealt with two entrapment cases.  In Mr. Ahmad’s case, the police got a tip that someone  named “Romeo” was selling drugs over the phone. The officer called “Romeo’s”  phone number. He didn’t know if the tip was trustworthy. He had a short  conversation with “Romeo,” who agreed to sell him cocaine. They met in person  and “Romeo” sold the officer cocaine. Police arrested and searched “Romeo,” who  turned out to be Mr. Ahmad.  The trial judge said Mr. Ahmad wasn’t entrapped. This  was because police confirmed enough about the tip during their conversation to  have a good reason to suspect he was already selling drugs. They did this  before they asked to buy drugs from him. Mr. Ahmad was convicted. In Mr. Williams’ case, a police officer got  information from another officer that someone named “Jay” was selling cocaine.  The information also came from a tip. The officer didn’t know if the  information was trustworthy or recent. Another officer called Jay’s number and  asked to buy crack cocaine. “Jay” agreed to meet and sold the officer crack.  “Jay” turned out to be Mr. Williams. The police arranged another drug deal eleven  days later. A month later, police arrested Mr. Williams. The trial judge said police didn’t have a reasonable  suspicion of Mr. Williams before they asked to buy drugs from him. The trial  judge said Mr. Williams was entrapped, and ordered a stay of proceedings. The Court of Appeal heard both appeals together,  because they dealt with the same issue. It said neither Mr. Ahmad nor Mr.  Williams were entrapped.  All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Mr.  Ahmad wasn’t entrapped, but for different reasons. The majority said Mr.  Williams was entrapped. The majority said police can ask a person answering a  phone to commit a crime. But they can only do this if they already have  reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion must be about a specific person  committing a crime or crime happening in a specific place. But in this digital  age, a place doesn’t have to be physical. It can be a phone number. So, police  need a good reason to suspect that the person answering is committing a certain  crime or the phone number is being used for that crime before asking them to  commit a crime.  Police don’t have reasonable suspicion if they just  have a tip and don’t know if it’s reliable. They can develop reasonable suspicion  by investigating if a tip is reliable before calling. The majority said it’s  better to have reasonable suspicion before making the call. But it’s also possible  to establish reasonable suspicion by having a conversation with the person who  answers.  In both appeals, the police didn’t have reasonable  suspicion before calling the phone numbers. But the majority said Mr. Ahmad  wasn’t entrapped because police developed a good reason to suspect he was  selling drugs while talking to him on the phone. They did this before they asked  to buy drugs from him. The police didn’t confirm the tip during the phone call  in Mr. Williams’ case, though. The majority said Mr. Williams <em>was</em> entrapped because the police asked  to buy drugs from him before they had a good reason to suspect he was selling drugs.  Mr. Ahmad got permission (or “leave”) to appeal  to the Supreme Court. People who get convicted on appeal when they weren’t  convicted at trial, like Mr. Williams, can appeal “as of right” (meaning they  don’t need permission)."
2020 SCC 10,"<strong>Judges can stop creditors  from voting on how to settle insolvent companies’ debts and can approve  “interim financing” from third parties to fund lawsuits, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>
   When a company doesn’t have money  to pay back its debts, it’s “insolvent.” If an insolvent company owes people  (creditors) more than $5 million, it can get help through the <em>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act</em> (CCAA). Under the CCAA, it can work out agreements with its creditors to pay  them back. A “supervising judge” oversees this process.  9354-9186 Québec inc., also known as Bluberi, was insolvent.  It owed a lot of money to Callidus because Callidus had given it a loan. The  loan was “secured,” meaning if Bluberi didn’t pay, Callidus could take things  Bluberi owned. (A mortgage loan is a kind of secured loan.) This made Callidus  a “secured creditor.” Bluberi also had “unsecured creditors” (like its  employees).  Bluberi agreed to sell what it owned to Callidus to  pay its debt. The agreement said Callidus would get Bluberi’s assets, and  Bluberi would only owe Callidus $3 million. The agreement also said Bluberi  could keep the right to sue Callidus. Bluberi wanted to sue because it blamed  Callidus for its insolvency problems. This right to sue was the only thing of  value that Bluberi had left. Bluberi still had other debts. It wanted to use money  from the lawsuit against Callidus to pay them. But Callidus wanted to settle  Bluberi’s debts in a different way. It put forward a “plan of arrangement.” A  plan of arrangement is a proposal about how to pay an insolvent company’s  creditors. A plan of arrangement needs to be approved by the company’s  creditors. Under Callidus’s plan, some of Bluberi’s creditors would get  everything they were owed, but some would only get part. In exchange, Bluberi  would have to give up its right to sue Callidus. Bluberi’s unsecured creditors  voted and rejected the plan. Callidus could have tried to vote, but chose not  to. Bluberi then came up with a way to get the money it  needed to sue Callidus, through a “third-party litigation funding agreement.” A  company would provide the money in exchange for part of anything Bluberi won  from Callidus. Bluberi asked the supervising judge to approve this agreement as  “interim financing.” Interim financing is money that helps a company make use  of the assets it has left. But Callidus said the agreement was a plan of  arrangement, and that the creditors needed to vote on it.  At the same time, Callidus put forward a new plan,  which was basically the same as its first one. Callidus asked the supervising  judge if it could vote on the new plan. If it could vote, its plan would pass. The supervising judge said Callidus couldn’t vote. He  said it was acting with an “improper purpose.” He said Callidus chose not to  try to vote the first time, and was now trying to override the result of that  vote. He decided Bluberi could go forward with its litigation funding agreement  without a vote because the agreement was fair and wasn’t a plan of arrangement. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the supervising  judge. The Supreme Court unanimously said the supervising  judge’s decisions should stand. It said appeal courts should give a great deal  of respect to a supervising judge’s decisions, even if they would have made  different ones. The supervising judge oversees the case from start to finish,  knows the specific situation the best, and is in the best position to balance  the many goals of the CCAA. One of the CCAA’s goals is to help companies stay  in business. Another goal is to make sure creditors get back as much of the  money they are owed as possible.   In this case, the Supreme Court  said the supervising judge balanced those goals properly. It said he was  allowed to stop Callidus from voting if it was acting with an improper purpose,  which it was. He was also allowed to approve Bluberi’s litigation funding  agreement as interim financing, if he thought it was appropriate. He was right  to think that it was. The agreement was meant to help Bluberi make use of the  only asset it had left (its right to sue Callidus). This case was decided  “from the bench” right after the hearing on January 23, 2020. When a case is  decided from the bench, it means the judges tell the parties the outcome right  away. In this case, the judges gave written reasons later to explain."
2020 SCC 9,"<strong>NOTE</strong>:  this  document contains details about sexual violence against a child that may be  upsetting to some readers.<strong>Courts should impose tougher punishments for sexual  crimes against children, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   Mr. Friesen met a woman online. One night, he was at the  woman’s home. The woman’s friend was also there, babysitting the woman’s two  kids. Mr. Friesen and the woman had sex. He then told her to bring her four-year-old  daughter to the bedroom so he could do something sexually violent to her. The  woman carried her sleeping daughter into the room and put her on the bed. The child  woke up. She started to cry. She tried to get away. Mr. Friesen was hurting  her. The woman’s friend woke up. She came and took the child away. Mr. Friesen  told the woman to bring the child back. He said if she didn’t do it, he would  tell the friend that the woman had sexually assaulted her one-year-old son. But  the friend confronted Mr. Friesen, and he left. The woman recorded everything  on her phone. Mr.  Friesen pleaded guilty to sexual interference (touching someone under 16  in a sexual way). He also pleaded guilty to trying to extort the woman  (threatening her to make her do something). The judge who decided the sentence said Mr. Friesen  should go to prison for six years. He got six years by comparing Mr. Friesen’s  case to another case. That case said a sentence should start at four to five  years. The Court of Appeal said the judge made a mistake. It said he shouldn’t  have relied on the other case as a starting point, because the facts were  different. In that other case, there was a “relationship of trust” between the  child and the abuser. A “relationship of trust” is a relationship where the adult  should protect the child and keep them safe. For example, a parent-child or  teacher-student relationship. Violating a relationship of trust is very  serious. The Court of Appeal said Mr. Friesen didn’t have a relationship of  trust with the child. It said he should go to prison for four and a half years. The  judges at the Supreme Court were unanimous. All the judges said the original six-year  sentence should stand. Given the facts, they said six years was actually a light  sentence. Protecting  children is one of the basic values of Canadian society. In 2012, over half of  victims of sexual crimes reported to police were under 18. These crimes are  often hidden because they are often done in homes, by someone the child knows  and trusts.  Our  understanding of sexual violence against children has changed over the years.  Parliament made punishments for sexual crimes tougher. It also said judges  should focus on preventing and condemning sexual crimes against children when  deciding sentences. The Supreme Court judges said that sentences have to  reflect the harm to the child, which can last a lifetime, and might not be  fully known right away. They said sentences also have to reflect society’s  deeper understanding of the wrongfulness of sexual violence against children. The  Supreme Court judges said courts should start giving higher sentences for  sexual crimes against children. They said longer sentences (for example, ten  years or more) shouldn’t be unusual. They said sexual crimes against children  should be punished more severely than sexual crimes against adults. They noted  Parliament made the maximum sentences the same for sexual interference and  sexual assault of a child, so one isn’t less serious than the other. The judges  set out a list of factors to help lower courts decide an appropriate sentence.  They didn’t create strict ranges or starting points, though. They said courts  of appeal should do this because they know their local situations best.  Some  people said using starting points (instead of ranges) for sentences caused  problems. But the Supreme Court didn’t decide on this. The judges said they  would wait for a more appropriate case. The  Supreme Court judges said appeal courts should only change a sentence if the  sentencing judge made a legal mistake. But in this case, the sentencing judge  considered the facts properly and there was no mistake. Sexual crimes  against children are serious and widespread. These crimes are the original  basis of many cases that come to the Supreme Court. The actual legal issues  appealed may be different, though. Recent cases that started out as charges for  sexual crimes against children and teenagers include <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2020/38532-eng.aspx"">R. v.

2020 SCC 8,"<strong>Excessive speeding can be dangerous driving, even if it’s just for a few  seconds, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   In  2015, Mr. Chung was driving down a street in Vancouver. The speed limit was 50  km/h. Over the span  of one block, just before a major intersection, Mr. Chung moved into the curb  lane. He passed at least one car on the right and dodged another while  accelerating to 140 km/h. He hit a car that was turning left. The driver  of the other car died. Mr. Chung was charged with dangerous driving causing  death. To be guilty of a crime, a person must <em>do</em> something that is against the (criminal) law. This is called the “<em>actus reus</em>,” which means “guilty act” in  Latin. But something has to make the person <em>responsible</em> for what they’ve done. This is called the “<em>mens  rea</em>,” which means “guilty mind” in Latin. For many crimes, <em>mens  rea</em> is based on intent. But for some crimes, a person can be responsible  even if they don’t mean to do anything wrong. In these cases, a judge doesn’t have  to look at what the person themselves was thinking. Instead, they will look at  what an ordinary, sensible person (a “reasonable person”) would have done. If the  actions of the accused person and the “reasonable person” are very different, this  is called a “marked departure from the standard of care.” This “marked  departure” is the <em>mens rea</em> for crimes  like dangerous driving causing death. The <em>actus reus</em> for this crime is driving  in a way that is dangerous to the public and that results in death.  The trial judge said Mr. Chung’s extreme speeding over a short distance met  the requirement for the <em>actus reus</em>.  But he didn’t think Mr. Chung had the <em>mens  rea</em> or guilty mind. He said the brief period of speeding, on its own,  wasn’t enough to establish the <em>mens rea </em>for  dangerous driving causing death. The Crown appealed. When someone is found not guilty, the Crown can only  appeal if the judge made a legal error. It can’t appeal just because the decision  is unreasonable. The Crown said the trial judge made legal errors in this case. The Court of Appeal agreed that the trial judge made a legal error by concluding  that speeding over a short period of time wasn’t enough to show a “marked  departure.” Since the trial judge made all the necessary findings of fact, the  Court of Appeal could find that Mr. Chung had the <em>mens rea</em> for dangerous driving. Without the error, the trial judge  would have found Mr. Chung guilty. So the Court of Appeal replaced the “not  guilty” finding with “guilty.”
   The majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed that the trial  judge made legal errors. They  said the trial judge focused on comparing what Mr. Chung did to specific things  people had been found guilty for in other cases. He also focused on the fact  that his speeding was for a short period of time. But these weren’t the right  things to focus on. The trial judge should have looked at whether a reasonable  person would have foreseen a danger to the public and what they would have done  in the situation. The trial judge should have compared this to what Mr. Chung  did, and then decided if his conduct was a “marked departure.” The  majority said that Mr. Chung’s conduct was a “marked departure.” They said a  reasonable person would have foreseen that quickly accelerating toward a major intersection at a high  speed would create a risk, almost immediately, of hurting someone.  The majority of judges  said that a reasonable person understands that driving, by nature, is risky.  They said the faster someone drives, the harder they accelerate, and the more  aggressively they deal with traffic, the more risky it becomes. They said that  even careful driving can have tragic results. But some conduct is so dangerous  it deserves criminal punishment, like in this case. The majority confirmed that  Mr. Chung was guilty of dangerous driving causing death. The Supreme Court  needs to give permission to hear appeals in most cases. One exception is when a  Court of Appeal overturns a “not guilty” decision. That’s what happened in this  case, so Mr. Chung had a right to appeal without permission. This is called an  appeal “as of right.”"
2020 SCC 7,"<strong>The right to be tried in a reasonable time protects accused persons when  trial judges take too long to render their  decisions, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
   The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>is  part of Canada’s Constitution. Under section 11(b), anyone charged with a crime  has the right to be tried in a reasonable time. It protects both people accused  of crimes and society. Long criminal trials cause suffering and frustration for  everyone involved. People accused of crimes often sit in jail while waiting for  their trial. Victims and their families are left waiting for a final decision.  The public waits longer to see justice done. The right to be tried in a  reasonable time is important. If an accused person’s trial takes too long, it can  be stopped. This is called a “stay of proceedings.” It means there won’t be a  verdict of guilty or not guilty. In  July 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada decided an important appeal, <em><a href=""https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16057/index.do"">R. v.  Jordan</a></em>. <em>Jordan</em> set out rules to decide how long is too long for a criminal trial. It said that  most trials should finish either 18 or 30 months after a person is charged,  depending on the type of trial. <em>Jordan </em>tells  judges to “presume” (accept as true) that anything longer is “unreasonable,”  unless there is something unusual to justify it. (In this context,  “unreasonable” basically means “too long.”) If the time taken was unreasonable,  the proceedings have to be “stayed.” <em>Jordan</em> also set out  special rules for cases like K.G.K.’s, which had already started when the rules  changed. These were called “transitional” cases.  In  2013, K.G.K. was charged with sexual crimes against a child. His trial finished  in January 2016. The trial judge took nine months to decide the case. In  October 2016, he found K.G.K. guilty. The day before, K.G.K. asked for a stay  of proceedings. He said that his case had taken longer than the usual 30-month  maximum. He said the trial judge had taken too long to give his decision. The  Crown (the prosecution) argued that the time taken was reasonable because  K.G.K.’s case was “transitional”. It said the trial judge’s decision-making  time didn’t count toward the <em>Jordan</em> time limit. The  judge who dealt with K.G.K.’s request for a stay said the trial judge’s time  shouldn’t be counted under <em>Jordan</em>. A  majority of the Court of Appeal agreed. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that the time a trial judge takes to  decide a case doesn’t count toward the <em>Jordan </em>time limit.<strong> </strong>The majority said at  the time <em>Jordan </em>was decided, there  was a real problem with delays in getting people to trial. The criminal justice  system had become too accepting of those delays. But there wasn’t any evidence  of a problem with the time trial judges were taking to give their decisions. So <em>Jordan </em>didn’t deal with that. The  majority created a new approach to decide if a trial judge has taken too long  to give their decision. It said that trial judges should be presumed to take  only the time necessary to deliver a fair decision. Trial judges know that criminal  charges should be dealt with as quickly as possible. As the people dealing with  all the evidence and arguments, they are in the best position to figure out how  long they need to decide the case. Still, sometimes trial judges take too long.  If the accused can show that the trial judge took “markedly longer” (a lot  longer) than was reasonably necessary to make their decision, the proceedings  will be stayed.  In  this case, the majority said the trial judge took a long time, but not “markedly longer” than he should have. It also noted  that the whole trial, and a lot of the time the trial judge took to decide,  happened before <em>Jordan</em> came out. The  majority said if this case had happened after <em>Jordan</em>, its decision would likely have been different. Besides the  time the judge took, the majority said that any other delay in K.G.K.’s case  was reasonable. This was because his case was “transitional.”
     This was one of two  cases heard during the Supreme Court’s <a href=""/court-cour/events-evenements/winnipeg/index-eng.aspx"">visit  to Winnipeg</a>, Manitoba in September 2019. It was the first time in  history the Court sat outside of Ottawa."
2020 SCC 6,"<strong>How a taxpayer uses a “derivative contract” determines how it is treated  for tax purposes, the Supreme Court has ruled. </strong>
   Mr. MacDonald had  worked in finance and owned a large number of shares. He started a business. He  got a loan from his bank. He used some shares to “secure” part of the loan. If  he couldn’t pay back what he borrowed, the bank could take the shares as “security.”  He could borrow up to 95% of the value of the shares. This was over $10  million.  Mr. MacDonald and his  bank also signed a “forward contract” covering the shares. A forward contract  is an agreement to buy (or sell) something at a specific price on a future  date. It is a kind of “derivative contract,” which is a contract based on an  “underlying asset” (in this case, the shares). These kinds of contracts are  common in the financial world. Forward contracts can be for “speculation” or  for “hedging.” “Speculation” is when someone invests in something that  increases their risk, hoping for a high return. It is more like gambling.  “Hedging” is when someone invests in something to reduce risks of price changes  in something else. It is more like insurance. In this case, if the  value of the shares went up, Mr. MacDonald agreed to pay the difference between  the new price and the price in the forward contract. If the value of the shares  went down, the bank would pay him. The money Mr. MacDonald got would be used as  extra security for the loan. The price of the shares  increased. Mr. MacDonald paid his bank about $10 million. These payments were  “cash settlement payments” under the forward contract. The issue in this case  was how Mr. MacDonald claimed the cash settlement payments on his income tax.  Under the <em>Income Tax Act</em>, there are  two basic categories of earnings. The first category is ordinary income from  things like employment and business. The second is capital gains or losses,  which are the profits (or losses) you get from selling something for more (or  less) than you paid for it. How gains and losses are treated can make a big  financial difference for a taxpayer. Whether the payments from the forward  contract were income losses or capital losses depended on whether the forward  contract was a hedge or speculation. Mr. MacDonald said he  was using the forward contract to speculate. This meant the payments he made  should be deducted from his business income. Canada Revenue Agency said he was  using the forward contract to hedge. This meant the payments were capital  losses. The  Tax Court said the forward contract was speculation. The Federal Court of  Appeal said it was a hedge. The majority of judges  at the Supreme Court said the purpose of a derivative contract determines  whether it is a hedge or speculation. They said the purpose of Mr. MacDonald’s  contract was hedging. This meant the payments were capital losses. To find the  purpose of the forward contract, the majority looked at how closely it was tied  to the shares (the “underlying asset”). The more closely a derivative contract  is tied to the underlying asset, and the better it is at lowering risk, the  more likely it is to be a hedge. Otherwise, it’s more likely to be speculation. Shares can go up or  down in value over time. But in this case, the majority noted the forward  contract protected Mr. MacDonald from this risk and uncertainty. This  protection was almost perfect. The loan agreement and the agreement to use the  shares as security weren’t part of the forward contract. But the majority said  they were important context for determining the purpose of the forward  contract. Mr. MacDonald had to provide the bank with shares and with any  payments from the forward contract as security for the loan. The amount of money  he could borrow was tied to the value of his shares. The amount of shares he  provided as security for the loan were the same number of shares covered by the  forward contract. This allowed the bank to give Mr. MacDonald a good deal  because it faced very little risk if he didn’t pay back his loan. This arrangement  showed enough of a connection between the contract and the shares to indicate a  hedging purpose. This case started as  a disagreement with Canada Revenue Agency. Tax disagreements can be appealed to  the Tax Court of Canada, which focuses on tax cases."
2020 SCC 5,"<strong>A lawsuit against a Canadian company for violations of customary  international law in Eritrea can go forward, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>
     Eritrea  is a country in east Africa. It has a “National Service Program,” where all  Eritreans have to do military training and military or other public service  when they turn eighteen. But people in this program are forced to work for  years and years on projects supported by military or political party officials. The  Bisha mine was built starting in 2008. It is owned by the Bisha Mining Share  Company. Workers from the National Service Program were used to help build it. They  were forced to work under harsh and dangerous conditions for years. They  weren’t allowed to leave. They were beaten and punished in many ways. Three  workers said they arrived at the Bisha mine between 2008 and 2010. They said  they were forced to work at least twelve hours a day, six days a week, in  temperatures close to 50ºC. They escaped Eritrea between 2011 and 2013 and  became refugees.  Nevsun  is a Canadian company based in British Columbia. It owns the Bisha Mining Share  Company. The workers sued Nevsun, saying it was responsible for slavery; forced  labour; cruel, unusual, or degrading treatment; and crimes against humanity.  They said these were violations of “customary international law.” They said  customary international law was part of Canadian law. They said that meant Canadian  courts should be able to hold Nevsun responsible for the harm they suffered.  “Customary  international law” is part of international law. It is like the common law of  the international legal system. Within customary international law, some rules are  so important that no one is allowed to ever break them. These are called  “peremptory norms.” (“Peremptory,” is pronounced per-REMP-torr-ee. Peremptory  norms are rules that can never be avoided). The violations the workers were  claiming were violations of peremptory norms. Nevsun  said British Columbia courts didn’t have the power to rule on the workers’ lawsuit.  It said it was immune because of something called the “act of state doctrine.” This  doctrine says courts in one country aren’t allowed to rule on what another  country does. It had never been applied in Canada before. Nevsun also  said it couldn't be sued for violating customary international law.  The  lower courts said the workers’ lawsuit could go forward.  The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada said the act of state  doctrine wasn’t part of Canadian law.  The majority said that customary international law is part of Canadian law,  though. It said customary international law becomes part of Canadian law  automatically. This is different than treaty law, which needs Parliament to  pass a law to bring it into force. Because customary international law is part  of Canadian law, courts could, in the right cases, find Canadian companies responsible  for violating it. The majority noted that violations of peremptory norms are serious  violations of rights that are important to everyone, everywhere. They need to  be strongly discouraged. The Court didn’t decide whether Nevsun was responsible  for violating the workers’ rights. It said that the workers’ lawsuit could go  forward. It said that the trial judge would have to decide whether Nevsun  breached customary international law and—if it did—how it should be held  responsible.

2020 SCC 4,"<strong>Quebec courts can decide whether mining harmed an  Indigenous people’s traditional territory, even though part of the territory is  in Newfoundland and Labrador, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>The Innu are First Nations. They have lived in what is  now Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador since long before Europeans arrived. Around  1950, a large mining project started. It spanned both provinces. The Innu said  it was on their traditional territory. They said the mining companies didn’t  ask permission to mine there. In 2013, the Innu sued the companies. They said  the project prevented them from enjoying and moving around their territory. The  Innu asked for three things. They asked for the companies to stop work on the  project. They asked the companies to pay them for damages. And they asked the  court to declare they had aboriginal title and other aboriginal rights over  their traditional territory. The Innu sued in Quebec. But they  were asking Quebec courts to make a declaration about aboriginal title and  rights over their whole traditional territory. Part of it is in Newfoundland  and Labrador. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador said Quebec courts  weren’t allowed to make a declaration affecting Newfoundland and Labrador.  The lower courts said Quebec courts could decide all  the issues. The majority of judges at the  Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts. The judges looked at rules about how  courts deal with issues that cross borders. They also looked at the nature of  aboriginal title and rights. Courts in a  province generally can decide cases within their borders. But they have rules  to deal with issues that cross provincial borders. Quebec courts have the power  to decide cases where the person being sued (the defendant) lives in Quebec. This  is true even if the lawsuit is related to something that happened outside  Quebec. The rules are different if the lawsuit is about property outside  Quebec, though. In this case, both mining companies were based in Montreal.  This meant the Innu could ask Quebec courts to make them pay damages and to  stop mining work.  The  majority noted that having aboriginal rights and title to land isn’t the same  as owning property. The concept of property ownership comes from civil and  common law (legal traditions that arrived with Europeans). Aboriginal title is  different. It belongs to a group, not an individual. It’s for the benefit of  future generations, not just the current one. And it can’t simply be sold. Aboriginal  title is really about the relationship between “the Crown” (Canada) and  Indigenous groups. The Crown has an obligation to act honourably within this  relationship. This is called “the honour of the Crown.” The majority said the  honour of the Crown must always be interpreted in a way that brings us closer  to reconciliation. Section  35 of the Constitution specifically recognizes aboriginal and treaty rights. It  acknowledges that Indigenous peoples lived in what we now call Canada before  Europeans arrived. It also acknowledges that the Crown has sovereignty (the  power to govern). Section 35 is meant to find a way to work within these two  realities. Since aboriginal rights existed before Crown sovereignty, the  majority said provincial borders shouldn’t affect those rights. That means groups  like the Innu shouldn’t have to fight the same legal battle in courts in  different provinces applying the same law. This would lead to more cost and  confusion. It could even mean the Innu wouldn’t be able to pursue their rights.  This would go against the honour of the Crown. This decision didn’t say whether the  Innu should get what they were asking for. It only said Quebec had the power to  make a declaration about aboriginal rights and title over the Innu’s traditional  territory. Quebec courts could do this even though some of that territory was  in Newfoundland and Labrador. (Quebec courts could still say it was more  appropriate for courts in Newfoundland and Labrador to decide, though.) Even if  the Quebec courts said the project violated the Innu’s aboriginal rights and  title, they couldn’t force Newfoundland and Labrador to do anything. The Innu  would still have to negotiate with the government or go to court in that  province.   In this case, the Court looked at reconciliation  and the honour of the Crown. It had to decide how to apply these concepts when  deciding which court had power to decide on aboriginal rights and title. The  Court previously dealt with the honour of the Crown in <em><a href=""../37441-eng.aspx"">Mikisew Cree First  Nation v. Canada (Governor General in Council)</a></em>."
2021 SCC 54,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that communications during family mediation sessions may be  used to prove the existence of a settlement agreement between the spouses.  </strong>
   This is a family law case from Quebec involving spouses who participated  in family mediation to resolve the terms of their separation. In Quebec, family  mediation by certified mediators is made available to married, civil union and common  law spouses with or without children. This process is subsidized by the provincial  government.  Ms. Isabelle Bisaillon and Mr. Michel Bouvier were  common law spouses for more than three years. They had two children during that  time. After their relationship ended, they participated in several family  mediation sessions in 2012 with a certified mediator to resolve their disputes  about the children’s care, the family home and other matters. At the end of that  process, the mediator prepared a document known as a “summary of mediated  agreements” that explained how the parties had agreed to settle their disputes.     In 2014, Ms. Bisaillon filed a lawsuit in Quebec’s Superior Court for more  money than set out in the summary. Mr. Bouvier took the position they  should stick to the terms of the contract agreed to in mediation, and set out  in the summary. Ms. Bisaillon denied the existence of the contract and  objected to the summary being admitted in evidence. She said the summary was  protected by a rule of absolute confidentiality.  The Superior Court rejected Ms. Bisaillon’s argument. In its reasons,  the court relied on a commercial mediation case from 2014 called <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13632/index.do"">Union  Carbide Canada Inc. v. Bombardier Inc.</a></em> In that case, the  Supreme Court acknowledged the confidentiality of the mediation process, but  recognized the “settlement exception”. This exception allows parties to a  settlement to prove it exists. As such, the Superior Court found Ms. Bisaillon  and Mr. Bouvier had a contract. Ms. Bisaillon appealed to Quebec’s Court of  Appeal, which also sided with Mr. Bouvier. While Ms. Bisaillon decided not to  appeal that decision, Quebec’s Association de médiation familiale was permitted  to take Ms. Bisaillon’s case to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court has sided with Mr. Bouvier.  <strong>The settlement exception</strong> <strong>also applies to family mediation cases.</strong>
     Writing for the majority, Justice Nicholas Kasirer said the settlement  exception outlined in <em>Union Carbide</em> may  also apply to family mediation cases. He wrote, “It is certainly true that  confidentiality is necessary in any mediation to allow for frank discussion  between the parties in order to encourage settlements. It is also true that,  unlike in the case of civil or commercial mediation, negotiations following the  breakdown of a relationship often take place during a period of personal  upheaval that may heighten the vulnerability of either spouse.”  However, Justice Kasirer explained how the family mediation process  includes other safeguards beyond confidentiality to assure the protection of  vulnerable parties. These additional safeguards include a certified and  impartial mediator chosen by the parties and a judge who confirms any agreement  arising from the mediation.  Due to these important safeguards, a rule of  absolute confidentiality is not required. This means people may use the  settlement exception to prove the existence and terms of what they agreed to  during mediation. "
2021 SCC 53,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules the City of  Montreal could not apply payments from Quebec’s voluntary reimbursement program  to cover the amount it owed to a contractor. </strong>
   This case involves the  City of Montreal and one of its contractors, an engineering firm called SM  Group. In 2018, SM Group sought to avoid bankruptcy by applying to Quebec’s  Superior Court for protection under the <em>Companies’  Creditors Arrangement Act</em> (<em>CCAA</em>).  This process is called restructuring.  SM Group had also  participated in a two-year voluntary reimbursement program under a Quebec law meant  to help recover money paid “in the course of the tendering, awarding or  management of a public contract in relation to which there may have been fraud  or fraudulent tactics”. The 2015 law was in response to the Charbonneau  Commission of inquiry into collusion and corruption in public contracts with  the construction industry.  The Superior Court granted  SM Group’s application. It appointed Deloitte Restructuring (Deloitte) to  monitor the company’s restructuring and ordered a “stay of proceedings”. The  stay meant that all legal actions against the company were put on hold to give  the engineering firm the opportunity to get its business back on track.  Following that initial  court order, SM Group continued with the construction of the  Samuel De Champlain Bridge and the rebuilding of the Turcot  Interchange in Montreal. However, the City refused to pay for that work. It  said it could use “pre-post compensation” to reduce or cancel the amount owed  for the work performed by SM Group. This meant the City would apply payments  from the voluntary reimbursement program (VRP) to cover the amount owed for the  work done on the bridge and interchange. Pre-post compensation is usually not  allowed by the courts, but the City said it should be allowed in this case because  the money SM Group owed through the VRP resulted from fraud.  In response to the  City’s refusal to pay, Deloitte applied to the Superior Court to stop the City  from using pre-post compensation. The court granted Deloitte’s application,  which the City then appealed. When the Court of Appeal agreed the City could  not use pre-post compensation, the City turned to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has also agreed  the City could not use pre-post compensation.  <strong>The City failed to prove the <abbr title=""voluntary reimbursement program"">VRP</abbr> claim was fraudulent. </strong>
     Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice Wagner and Justice Côté explained that a <abbr title=""voluntary reimbursement program"">VRP</abbr> claim is not  necessarily fraudulent. They wrote, “the mere fact that a debtor company  participated in the VRP is not sufficient to infer that the company defrauded a  public body”. In this case, the City of Montreal still had the burden of  proving that SM Group had committed fraud, which the City failed to do.  The majority  said a court should generally not allow pre-post compensation, unless there are  exceptional circumstances. They said there were no such exceptional  circumstances in this case."
2021 SCC 51,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules Loblaw  Financial Holdings Inc. can benefit from a Canadian tax exception involving a bank  it owns in Barbados. </strong>This is a tax case involving Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc. (Loblaw  Financial), a Canadian company. Loblaw Financial is owned by the Loblaw Group,  which also owns grocery stores.   In 1992, Loblaw Financial opened a bank in Barbados called Glenhuron  Bank Limited (Glenhuron). Glenhuron did corporate banking, meaning it managed  the money of various companies.  Between 1992 and 2000, both the Loblaw Group and Loblaw Financial  invested money in Glenhuron. In 2013, however, the Loblaw Group closed Glenhuron.  In its Canadian tax returns for the years 2001 to 2005, 2008, and 2010,  Loblaw Financial did not include the money made by Glenhuron, claiming the  revenue was exempt from the <em>Income Tax  Act. </em>The law says Canadian companies must pay taxes on money made by their  foreign affiliates, meaning companies they own abroad. That money is called  “foreign accrual property income” (FAPI). However, a bank can get a tax  exception if it was doing business mainly with companies that are not related  to it. This is known as the “arm’s length requirement”. The Minister of National Revenue of Canada denied the tax exception, so  Loblaw Financial appealed to the Tax Court of Canada. At Tax Court, the  Minister argued the exception did not apply and the Tax Court agreed.  Loblaw Financial appealed that decision to the Federal Court of Appeal,  which sided with Loblaw Financial and said the exemption did in fact apply. The  Minister then turned to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has sided with Loblaw Financial: the tax exception  did apply, so Loblaw Financial did not have to pay taxes on the money made by  Glenhuron. <strong>The arm’s length requirement was  met. </strong>
     Writing for the Supreme Court, Justice Côté explained “the FAPI regime  is one of the most complicated statutory regimes in Canadian law”. But she said  the question in this appeal is simple. Is a company “doing business” with a foreign  affiliate when it manages and gives money to it? She said the answer is no. When  the arm’s length requirement in the <em>Income  Tax Act</em> is read in its grammatical and ordinary sense, it is clear money and management to an  affiliate is not included in “doing business”.  Loblaw Financial managed and gave money to Glenhuron, but it was not  doing business with it. Rather, as a corporate bank, Glenhuron was doing  business with other companies not related to it. So, the arm’s length  requirement was met. As a result, the tax exception applied, and Loblaw  Financial did not have to pay taxes on the money made by Glenhuron for the  years in question. "
2021 SCC 49,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules a Luxembourg company can benefit from  a Canadian tax exemption due to an existing tax treaty.</strong>  An American oil and gas company created  a Luxembourg subsidiary called Alta Luxembourg, which had its own subsidiary in  Canada called Alta Canada. A subsidiary is a company that is owned by another  company.  In 2013, Alta Luxembourg sold its  shares in Alta Canada and made more than $380 million in profit. Alta  Luxembourg paid taxes on the profit to Luxembourg tax authorities. In its  Canadian tax return, Alta Luxembourg claimed a tax exemption on the basis that  the profit was not “taxable income earned in Canada”. It supported its claim by  relying on the tax treatybetween  Canada and Luxembourg. The agreementexempts  Luxembourg companies who profit from selling shares in Canada from paying taxes  as long as the shares relate to buildings and lands in Canada where the company  conducts business.  The Minister of National Revenue of  Canada denied the exemption and Alta Luxembourg appealed to the Tax Court of  Canada.  Before  the Tax Court, the Minister argued that Alta Luxembourg could not qualify for  the exemption because Alta Canada did not do business on the property. The Minister also said that the only  reason Alta Luxembourg existed was to sell the shares without having to pay taxes  to Canadian tax authorities. Lawyers for the Minister said that was abusive tax  avoidance. The Tax Court sided with Alta Luxembourg.  The Minister appealed that  decision to the Federal Court of Appeal. It also sided with Alta Luxembourg,  finding no abusive tax avoidance.  The Minister then turned to the  Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal.  <strong>There was no abusive tax avoidance.</strong>
     Writing for the majority, Justice  Côté said the Minister had not proven abusive tax avoidance. She said Canada  had agreed to include exemptions for buildings and lands in the tax treaty to  encourage investments by Luxembourg residents and companies. Alta Luxembourg  made such an investment. As a result, it can claim a tax exemption and the  anti-avoidance provisions of the Canadian <em>Income  Tax Act</em> cannot be used to deny the exemption. "
2021 SCC 48,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds convictions for  two men who were operating a sexual escort service.  </strong>
     The question in this case is how courts should treat crimes that are  committed after the Supreme Court of Canada declares a law unconstitutional but  before that declaration takes effect. That is what happened when Mr. Tamim  Albashir and Mr. Kasra Mohsenipour were convicted in 2019 for offences that  occurred between 2013 and 2016. At that time, the men were operating a sexual  escort service in Vancouver. Among the offences was a violation of section  212(1)(j) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which  barred pimps from living off the money made by sex workers. In 2013, in the case of <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13389/index.do"">Canada  (Attorney General) v. Bedford</a></em>, the Supreme Court found Canada’s  prostitution laws were unconstitutional, including section 212(1)(j). The  judges found that it had criminalized all sex work, instead of focusing on  controlling and abusive pimps. The Supreme Court gave Parliament a one year  “suspension period” to change the law, which it did in 2014. Mr. Albashir and  Mr. Mohsenipour committed the section 212(1)(j) offences during that suspension  period, but were charged after it ended.      At their trial, the question was whether the old law had become  unconstitutional, preventing the men from being convicted. The trial judge decided  that the law had indeed been unconstitutional at the time the crimes were  committed and quashed the charges against both men.  The Crown appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which convicted  the men. The Court of Appeal held that the Supreme Court’s declaration of  unconstitutionality had never taken effect because Parliament had replaced  section 212(1)(j) before the end of the suspension period. Mr. Albashir and Mr.  Mohsenipour appealed their convictions to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals.  <strong>The men could be charged and  convicted under section 212(1)(j) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> after the suspension period had ended for conduct committed during it.   </strong>
     Writing for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis explained that a  retroactive declaration means the law is considered to have always been invalid.  A prospective declaration, on the other hand, means the law is considered to be  invalid only after the suspension period has ended and the declaration of  constitutional invalidity has taken effect.     In the<em> Bedford</em> case, the Court had not said whether that declaration  would apply retroactively or prospectively. But the purpose for the suspension  was to continue to protect vulnerable sex workers while Parliament replaced  section 212(1)(j) with a new law. In light of this purpose, the majority in this  case said section 212(1)(j) was unconstitutional only after the suspension  period had ended. As a result, Mr. Albashir and Mr. Mohsenipour were liable under  this provision for their conduct during the suspension period, and could be  charged and convicted under it.

2021 SCC 47,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that an insurance company with no knowledge of a policy  violation may deny full coverage once made aware of the violation.</strong> 
   On May 29,  2006, Mr. Steven Devecseri died in a motorcycle accident where other people  were injured. Among them, Mr. Jeffrey Bradfield and Mr. Jeremy Caton decided to  sue his estate. Mr. Devecseri’s insurance company, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance  (RSA), proceeded to defend the estate in the two lawsuits.  Three years  after the accident, and more than a year into litigation, RSA learned Mr. Devecseri  had consumed alcohol immediately before the accident, putting him in breach of his  insurance policy. RSA promptly stopped defending Mr. Devecseri’s estate and  denied coverage. In doing so, Mr. Bradfield and Mr. Caton were no longer  eligible for $1 million under the insurance policy. Nearly three years later, Mr.  Caton’s action went to trial. The result was a judgment against Mr. Devecseri’s  estate as well as against Mr. Bradfield. There was also a judgment in favour of  Mr. Bradfield on his counter-claim against the estate.  Mr. Bradfield  sought a declaration allowing him to recover judgment against RSA on the basis  that the insurance company had waived its right to deny full coverage because  it had provided a defence to Mr. Devecseri’s estate as the litigation  progressed.  The trial  judge granted the declaration, finding that RSA had indeed waived its right to  deny full coverage. The Ontario Court  of Appeal allowed RSA’s appeal. It held that RSA could deny coverage, despite  having provided a defence to Mr. Devecseri’s estate, because it did not know of  his policy breach.  Mr. Bradfield  sought to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, but after being  granted leave, he settled with RSA and dropped his appeal. The Trial Lawyers  Association of British Columbia was permitted to be substituted as the  appellant. Although the appeal was moot, the Trial Lawyers Association wanted  to know how the Court would have decided the issue. An appeal is moot if the  dispute is already resolved. However, a court may decide to hear a case nonetheless,  to clarify the law on the issue.   The Supreme  Court agreed to hear the appeal, but ultimately sided with RSA.  <strong>Waiver by conduct was not  possible under the statute as it read at the time.</strong>
     Writing for a  majority of the judges, Justices Moldaver and Brown observed that the Trial  Lawyers Association had conceded, rightfully in their view, that waiver by  conduct was precluded by the <em>Insurance  Act</em> as it read at the time. The statute required that waiver be given in  writing and, in this case, the parties agreed that RSA had not given a waiver  in writing. Also, the  majority agreed with the Court of Appeal that RSA could deny coverage, despite  having defended claims against Mr. Devecseri’s estate, because it did not know  of his policy breach."
2021 SCC 46,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds sentences for two men convicted of wholesale drug  trafficking in Alberta. </strong>
   Two convicted drug dealers appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada  after the Alberta Court of Appeal increased their prison sentences. Patrick  Douglas Felix and Cameron O’Lynn Parranto pleaded guilty to several offences,  including the trafficking of wholesale fentanyl. Wholesale trafficking means  selling drugs in large quantities for others to then resell them. Mr. Felix  worked in Fort McMurray and his offences dated from 2015, whereas Mr. Parranto  worked in Edmonton and his offences dated from 2016. At trial Mr. Felix was  sentenced to seven years in prison and Mr. Parranto was sentenced to 11 years. Unsatisfied  with those sentences, the Crown appealed to Alberta’s Court of Appeal, which  heard the two cases together.  In its ruling, the Court of Appeal set a “starting point” sentence of  nine years for wholesale fentanyl trafficking and increased Mr. Felix’s  sentence to 10 years and Mr. Parranto’s to 14 years. A starting point gives the courts a place to  start when deciding an appropriate sentence. Both men then appealed their  longer sentences to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. A majority of the judges  found the sentences at trial were “demonstrably unfit”, meaning the sentences  were clearly unreasonable, and that the Court of Appeal’s ruling was  appropriate.  <strong>Appeal courts may set “starting  points” to help lower courts decide on appropriate sentences. </strong>
     The Supreme Court has confirmed that appeal courts may set starting  points to help lower courts decide appropriate sentences. The majority explained  that sentencing is, “one  of the most delicate stages of the criminal justice process”. It remains a  discretionary exercise that requires judges to consider and balance many  factors. The goal in every case is a fair, fit and principled sentence.  Proportionality is the most important principle in reaching this goal. Parity and  individualization are secondary principles. The majority wrote, “the question  is always whether the sentence reflects the gravity of the offence, the  offender’s degree of responsibility and the unique circumstances of each case.”  Trial courts are best positioned to craft a fit sentence for the offenders  before them.  The majority noted that appellate courts play two roles. They consider  the fitness of a sentence and promote stability in the development of the law,  while providing guidance to lower courts to ensure trial judges apply the law  consistently. Courts of appeal are well positioned to provide such guidance,  the judges wrote, because of their appreciation of overall sentencing practices,  patterns and problems in their jurisdiction.  Even so, the majority said appeal courts must give a high level of  deference to trial court sentencing decisions. Deviating from a sentencing  range or starting point alone does not justify the intervention of appeal  courts. It is only when a sentence is demonstrably unfit or the sentencing  judge made a mistake that an appeal court may vary the sentence. "
2021 SCC 45,"<strong>The Supreme Court orders a new trial  for a Saskatchewan man accused of armed robbery.</strong>
   Two people robbed  a Subway restaurant in Regina, Saskatchewan on July 7, 2016. One wore a mask  and brandished a knife, while the other stood watch at the front door. The only  employee on duty at the time could not identify the two robbers, but the  restaurant security camera had captured images of the masked person.  An anonymous  tip implicated Jason William Cowan and he was arrested soon after. Mr. Cowan  denied having any involvement in the incident and he claimed to have an alibi. However,  he did admit to telling a group of people “how to do a robbery” on the same day  it occurred. Police also noted that Mr. Cowan had been wearing shoes that closely  resembled those worn by the masked person in the images from the security  camera.  When police  showed Mr. Cowan the images from the security camera, he named two of his  acquaintances. He called the lookout person “Littleman” and the armed robber Mr.  Robinson. Mr. Cowan later named two more people. He told police that Mr.  Fiddler and Mr. Tone had driven Littleman and Mr. Robinson to the restaurant  and that they had waited in Mr. Fiddler’s vehicle during the robbery.  Mr. Cowan was  charged with armed robbery. He was tried by judge alone with no jury. At trial,  the Crown advanced two theories about what happened. The first was that Mr.  Cowan was the masked armed robber and, as a result, was guilty as a principal  offender. The second theory was that if he was not the masked man, Mr. Cowan was  a guilty party because he had either helped commit the crime or had advised  others on how to do it. The trial judge rejected both theories and acquitted  Mr. Cowan.  The Crown  appealed to the Court of Appeal, which agreed with the trial judge that Mr.  Cowan was not a principal offender. The judges did not all agree, however, with  the trial judge’s finding that the Crown had to first prove who had committed  the actual robbery before finding Mr. Cowan guilty of helping or advising  others on how to commit the crime. The majority of the Court of Appeal found  that this error may have affected the verdict. They allowed the appeal, set  aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial on the second theory of liability.  Both Mr.  Cowan and the Crown appealed the Court of Appeal’s ruling to the Supreme Court  of Canada. Mr. Cowan argued that the trial judge made no error and that his  acquittal should stand. The Crown argued that the Court of Appeal was not  allowed to limit a new trial to a single theory of liability. Instead, the  Crown said there should be a new trial on the charge of armed robbery as a  whole.  The Supreme Court has dismissed Mr. Cowan’s appeal and allowed the  Crown’s appeal. The new trial will be on the charge of armed robbery as a  whole.  <strong>New trial required</strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice  Moldaver said the trial judge committed an error of law in assessing Mr.  Cowan’s liability as a party to the offence.  To have an acquittal set aside due to a legal error, the Crown must  satisfy an appeal court to a reasonable degree of certainty that the error could  have changed the outcome of the trial. In this case, the judges said, the Crown  had satisfied the Court. They said that the verdict may well have been  different if the trial judge had considered the evidence in light of the  correct legal principles.  <strong>Appeal courts may not limit the  scope of a new trial to a particular theory of liability on a single criminal  charge. </strong>
     The majority  said the new trial should be a “full new trial” that is not limited to a  particular theory of liability. The majority explained that appeal courts may  not limit the scope of a new trial to a particular theory of liability on a  single criminal charge. They said, “as one of the purposes of the criminal  process is to foster a search for truth, justice cannot require that a trier of  fact be restricted in their ability to determine how, if at all, an accused  participated in a given offence. Rather, a trier of fact must be able to  consider any and all theories of liability that have an air of reality based on  the evidence adduced at the new trial.” "
2021 SCC 44,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that a foreign judgment against a Caribbean country cannot  be enforced in Ontario. </strong>
   This case  deals with the enforcement in Canada of a foreign judgment. Antigua and Barbuda  (Antigua) is a country comprised of several islands in the Caribbean. In 2007,  Antigua expropriated beachfront property owned by H.M.B. Holdings Limited  (H.M.B.), a company incorporated in that country.  In 2014, the  court of final appeal for Antigua ordered the government to compensate H.M.B.  for the expropriation. In 2016, H.M.B. started legal action in British Columbia  to enforce the judgment in that province. At the time of the action, Antigua  had no office or premises in British Columbia. However, for the purposes of its  Citizenship by Investment program, Antigua did have contracts with four authorized  representatives with their own businesses, premises and employees in British  Columbia.  Antigua did  not respond to the legal action, and a judgment by default was registered  against it in British Columbia’s Supreme Court. Shortly thereafter, H.M.B.  applied to have the British Columbia judgment registered in Ontario, so that it  could be enforced there. Ontario’s <em>Reciprocal  Enforcement of Judgments Act </em>(<em>REJA</em>)  allows a judgment from another province or territory to be registered for  enforcement in Ontario. Antigua  objected to H.M.B.’s application on the basis of two sections of the <em><abbr title=""Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act"">REJA</abbr></em>. Section 3(b) states that an entity  must be “carrying on business” in the jurisdiction where the judgment was  rendered. Section 3(g) states that a judgment can only be registered in Ontario  if the opposing party would have a good defense if ever the original judgment  were challenged. The Ontario  Superior Court of Justice decided the British Columbia judgment could not be  registered in Ontario. H.M.B. appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which  found that the British Columbia judgment could not be registered, because of section  3(b) of the <em><abbr title=""Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act"">REJA</abbr> </em>only. H.M.B. then appealed  to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme  Court has sided with Antigua.   <strong>Antigua was not “carrying on business” in British  Columbia</strong> <strong>where the judgment was rendered<em>,</em> so the judgment could not be  registered for enforcement in Ontario. </strong>
   Writing for a  majority of the judges, Chief Justice Wagner said section 3(b) of the <em><abbr title=""Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act"">REJA</abbr></em> bars H.M.B. from registering the  British Columbia judgment in Ontario, because Antigua was not “carrying on  business” in British Columbia. In light of this finding, the majority concluded  that it was unnecessary to consider whether section 3(g) also bars H.M.B. from  registering the judgment under the <em>REJA</em>.  <strong>What does “carrying on business” mean?</strong>
  The majority  explained that to determine whether a company is carrying on business in a  jurisdiction, the court must decide whether the company has some direct or  indirect presence there, accompanied by a degree of business activity that is sustained  for a period of time. Whether or not a company is carrying on business is a  question of fact. <strong>What is the purpose of the <em><abbr title=""Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act"">REJA</abbr></em>?</strong>
     The<em><abbr title=""Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act""> REJA </abbr></em>allows a person who has obtained a  judgment in another jurisdiction to apply to register the judgment in Ontario. A  judgment registered under the <em>REJA</em> is  treated as if the judgment was originally issued by an Ontario court. This law  is considered an easy,  economical and quick means of enforcing foreign judgments. "
2021 SCC 43,"<strong>The Supreme  Court finds the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to proceed  with the case of a comedian who mocked a well-known teen singer with a  disability, because it was not discrimination under  the Quebec Charter of human rights and freedoms. </strong><strong>The Court also explains the legal framework that applies to a  discrimination claim involving a public figure’s right to dignity and a  professional comedian’s freedom of expression. The Court said a reasonable  person would not view the comedian’s comments as inciting others to detest or vilify the young  person’s humanity.</strong>
   This case involves  professional comedian Mike Ward, who mocked a well-known young person with a  disability, Jérémy Gabriel. Between September 2010 and March 2013, Mr. Ward  performed a popular show called “Mike Ward s’Expose”, where he mocked several prominent  people from Quebec’s artistic community. Mr. Gabriel, a high school student  with a singing career, was among them. Mr. Ward also posted video clips of  himself mocking the Quebec artists. In 2012, Mr. Gabriel’s parents filed a  complaint with the <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la  jeunesse</span> (Commission), on their own behalf and on behalf of their son. The Commission concluded that there was a basis for discrimination. It took  Mr. Ward to the Quebec Human  Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) on behalf of Mr. Gabriel. Before the Tribunal, the  Commission argued that Mr. Ward’s show and online content infringed the Quebec <em>Charter of human rights and freedoms</em>, on  the basis of Mr. Gabriel’s disability. In his defence, Mr. Ward argued that he  had the right to say what he did about Mr. Gabriel, under the Quebec <em>Charter</em>’s protected right to freedom of  expression.  The Tribunal sided with the Commission. It  found Mr. Ward had infringed Mr. Gabriel’s right to dignity, without  discrimination, because of his disability under sections 4 and 10 of the Quebec <em>Charter</em>. The Tribunal also found that  Mr. Ward’s comments exceeded the limits of what a “reasonable  person” can tolerate as freedom of expression under section 3 of the Quebec <em>Charter</em>. In law, a reasonable person is a  hypothetical individual that is used as a legal standard to determine how a  typical person would think or behave. This concept is applied in many areas of  the law. Mr. Ward’s appeal of the  Tribunal’s decision was dismissed by a majority of the judges of the Quebec Court  of Appeal. He then appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has  found that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to proceed with this  case, because it was not a discrimination complaint.  <strong>This was a not discrimination complaint. </strong>
     Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Côté wrote for  the majority of judges. As they explained, the Tribunal had found that Mr. Gabriel  was the target of Mr. Ward’s jokes due to his fame, not due to his  disability, and fame is not a prohibited ground of discrimination under the  Quebec <em>Charter</em>. As a result, the  Tribunal did not have jurisdiction (that is, authority) to proceed with the  case. The majority noted  that the comments made by Mr. Ward about Mr. Gabriel did not lead to an action  in defamation, but rather to a discrimination claim. This distinction is  important because the Tribunal has no power to decide actions in defamation or  other civil liability actions, since its jurisdiction is limited to complaints  of discrimination under the Quebec <em>Charter</em>.  The Tribunal can hear disputes involving comments like those made in this case  only if they are allegedly discriminatory. <strong>Legal framework </strong>
     The  majority went on to explain the legal framework that applies to a  discrimination claim involving a public figure’s right to dignity, on the one  hand, and a professional comedian’s freedom of expression, on the other. Under the  first requirement of this framework, the majority said a reasonable person would not view  Mr. Ward’s comments about Mr. Gabriel as inciting others to  detest or vilify his humanity. They wrote, “making fun of a person’s physical characteristics  may be repugnant; it most certainly is when the person in question is a young  person with a disability who contributes with determination to society. But  expression of this kind does not, simply by being repugnant, incite others to  detest or vilify the humanity of the person targeted.”  Under  the second requirement of this framework, the  majority said a reasonable person could not view the comments as likely to  lead to discriminatory treatment of Mr. Gabriel.  As a result, the majority  concluded that the comments, “exploited,  rightly or wrongly, a feeling of discomfort in order to entertain, but they did  little more than that”. "
2021 SCC 42,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that an employment discrimination dispute involving a  unionized worker should be settled by a labour arbitrator appointed under the  collective agreement, not by a human rights adjudicator. </strong>
   This case involves a  dispute between an employee and her employer. The Supreme Court was asked if  the dispute should be heard by a labour arbitrator or a human rights adjudicator.  Ms. Linda Horrocks was  employed by the Northern Regional Health Authority (NRHA) in Manitoba. As a  unionized worker, the terms and conditions of her employment were set out in a  “collective agreement”. A collective agreement is a written contract between an  employer and a union.  In 2011, Ms. Horrocks was  suspended for being at work while under the influence of alcohol. She disclosed  to her employer her alcohol addiction, which is a disability. The health  authority asked Ms. Horrocks to formally agree to abstain from alcohol and get  treatment for her addiction. When she refused to sign the agreement, she was  fired. Her union filed a grievance on her behalf and, as a result, she returned  to work on essentially the same terms as the agreement she had refused to sign.  Soon after, the <abbr title=""Northern Regional Health Authority"">NHRA</abbr> alleged that she had broken the terms of that agreement.  Ms. Horrocks filed a discrimination  complaint with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission. She alleged the <abbr title=""Northern Regional Health Authority"">NHRA</abbr> failed to sufficiently accommodate her disability. A human rights adjudicator  was appointed to decide the complaint. The health authority opposed the adjudicator’s  jurisdiction. It argued that under the collective agreement, a labour arbitrator  should settle the dispute. The adjudicator disagreed because she said the  dispute was an alleged human rights violation. She went on to rule that the NRHA  had in fact discriminated against Ms. Horrocks.  The <abbr title=""Northern Regional Health Authority"">NHRA</abbr> appealed to a  reviewing judge who agreed with it. Ms. Horrocks then appealed to the Court of  Appeal. It said disputes concerning the termination of unionized workers do fall  within the exclusive jurisdiction of a labour arbitrator, even when there are  allegations of human rights violations. But in this case, the Court found the  adjudicator had jurisdiction and sent the case back to the reviewing judge to  decide if the adjudicator’s decision on the complaint itself was reasonable.  The health authority appealed  to the Supreme Court. It has ruled that the human rights adjudicator did not  have jurisdiction over Ms. Horrocks’ complaint.  <strong>A labour arbitrator should decide all disputes under a collective  agreement, including human rights disputes, unless another law states  otherwise. </strong>
     Writing for the majority  of the judges, Justice Brown said the human rights adjudicator did not have  jurisdiction over Ms. Horrocks’ complaint. Justice Brown explained that a  labour arbitrator has exclusive jurisdiction when labour legislation provides  for settling disputes under a collective agreement,<strong> </strong>unless another law states otherwise. In this case, Ms. Horrocks’  complaint arose under the collective agreement and within the mandate of a labour  arbitrator. Other legislation did not give concurrent jurisdiction to the human  rights adjudicator. As a result, the adjudicator did not have jurisdiction over  Ms. Horrocks’ complaint. "
2021 SCC 41,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that the City of Nelson can be held responsible for  injuries caused by its snow clearing decisions. </strong>
   After a heavy snowfall in January  2015, snow clearing crews for the City of Nelson in British Columbia started  plowing the streets. Not long after, Ms. Taryn Joy Marchi parked her car on  Baker Street in the downtown area. City crews had already plowed the street,  but they had created a snowbank along the curb of the sidewalk. Ms. Marchi decided  to walk over the snowbank to get from her car to the sidewalk and seriously  injured her leg. She sued the city for negligence.  The City of Nelson argued that it  should not have to pay any damages to Ms. Marchi, because snow clearing decisions  are “core policy  decisions” that are immune from negligence claims. Core policy decisions are  based on public policy considerations, such as economic, social and political  factors. They must be rational and not taken in bad faith.  At trial, the judge agreed with  the city that its snow clearing decision was a core policy decision and the city  did not have to pay any damages to Ms. Marchi. She appealed to the province’s  Court of Appeal, which disagreed with the trial judge and ordered a new trial. The  City of Nelson appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has agreed with  the Court of Appeal. The city can  be held responsible for injuries caused by its snow clearing decisions. <strong>Operational decisions  are not policy decisions.</strong>
     Writing for a unanimous Court,  Justices Karakatsanis and Martin agreed that core policy decisions are immune  from negligence claims. However, they pointed out that operational decisions to  carry out a policy are not policy decisions. They said, “the fact that the word  ‘policy’ is found in a written document” does not settle the question.  In analyzing the city’s snow  clearing decision in this case, the Court concluded that the decision was not a  core policy decision. Rather, the decision was operational and not immune from  a negligence claim. The judges said the city owed Ms. Marchi a “duty of care”  and that a new trial is required. The new trial would assess if the city  breached that duty of care and, as a result, whether it should pay damages to Ms.  Marchi.  <strong>What is a “duty of care”?</strong>
     A person making a negligence  claim must prove four things in court: a duty of care, a breach of that duty,  the cause and any damages. A duty of care means the other person or  organization was required to do, or avoid doing, something that could likely  cause harm."
2021 SCC 39,"<strong>The Supreme Court provides  guidance on how to interpret non-liability clauses under Quebec civil law. </strong>
  This case centers on a contract dispute between two companies. Prelco is  a large manufacturing company based in Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec, that makes and transforms flat glass for architectural and  industrial uses. In 2008, it hired a company called Createch to design  and install a management software system. The contract included what is known  as a “non-liability clause”. In this case, the clause limited Createch’s  liability should the software cause damages to Prelco such as the loss of data  or profits. After the software installation, Prelco experienced problems with  the system that affected its business. In 2010, Prelco ended its contract with  Createch and hired another company to fix the faulty system.  Prelco sued Createch for loss of profits and to recover the costs it paid  to have the other company repair the system. Createch responded with a  counterclaim against Prelco for an unpaid invoice.   The trial judge ruled that Createch could not invoke the “non-liability  clause” due to problems with the system. He said that even though Prelco signed  the contract with this non-liability clause, Createch must still meet its  fundamental obligation under the contract, which was the design and installation  of a software system that met Prelco’s needs. The judge awarded damages to Prelco,  but not as much as the company had requested. Both Createch and Prelco appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which dismissed  their appeals. Createch then appealed its case to the Supreme Court of Canada.  It argued that the non-liability clause was valid.   The Supreme Court has agreed with Createch.  <strong>Createch could limit its liability  toward Prelco under the contract.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Kasirer recognized that Createch had not met its fundamental obligation under the contract to design and install a software system that met Prelco’s needs. Despite that breach, they wrote that the non-liability clause was still valid. After all, the parties had agreed to it when negotiating the contract. The judges said, “the will of the parties had to be respected.”
In arriving at their conclusion, the judges explained the doctrine of breach of a fundamental obligation. According to this rule, a person or business cannot limit their liability for their primary service under a contract. This would make the contract meaningless. The judges said there are reasons for this rule under Quebec civil law, but these reasons do not apply in this case. In other words, Createch could rely on the non-liability clause in its contract with Prelco to limit its liability for the faulty system.   
     As a result, Createch will only have to pay Prelco what it cost to hire  another company to fix the faulty system. As for Prelco, it must pay the unpaid  invoice to Createch.  <strong>The contract in this case is  different than a consumer contract. </strong>Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Kasirer said the non-liability clause in this case was valid because it was negotiated by two sophisticated companies. This is different than for consumer contracts, where non-liability clauses are restricted by law to protect consumers who can be disadvantaged as compared to a company."
2021 SCC 37,"<strong>The Supreme Court orders a new trial for an Ontario man accused of  murder. </strong>
   In the early morning  hours of February 4, 2016, Peter Khill shot and killed Jonathan Styres, a young  man who was breaking into his truck. The vehicle was parked in the driveway of  Mr. Khill’s home, in a rural area on the outskirts of Hamilton, Ontario.  Before the shooting,  Mr. Khill was awoken by his partner who alerted him to loud noises  coming from the driveway next to their bedroom window. Looking out the window, Mr. Khill saw the dash lights  of his truck were on, indicating that someone was, or had been, in the truck.  At that point, Mr. Khill retrieved his shotgun, went outside and confronted Mr. Styres.  Moments later, he fired two shots, killing Mr. Styres.  When police arrived on  the scene, they arrested Mr. Khill. He told the arresting officer that he had  been a soldier. He also said the intruder had raised his hands to gun height,  so he reacted as he did. Mr. Khill was  charged with second degree murder. At trial, he testified that he shot Mr.  Styres in self-defence, believing Mr. Styres was armed and about to shoot him. Mr. Khill’s training as a former  part-time reservist was raised at trial.  A jury found Mr. Khill  not guilty and acquitted him. The Crown appealed. The Ontario  Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal and ordered a new trial, finding that  the jury was not property instructed on the principles of self-defence. Mr.  Khill appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed Mr. Khill’s appeal and  has ordered a new trial.   <strong>The trial judge should have  instructed the jury on self-defence and on Mr. Khill’s role in the incident. </strong><strong> </strong>
     Writing for the majority, Justice Martin said the jury received no  instructions from the trial judge on how Mr. Khill’s role in the incident  should inform its assessment of the reasonableness of his conduct. She said  this was an error that had an important effect on the verdict.  Justice Martin explained that a  “person’s role in the incident” refers to “the  person’s conduct … during the course of the incident, from beginning to end,  that is relevant to whether the ultimate act was reasonable in the  circumstances.” In this case, if the jury had been properly instructed, it may  have arrived at a different conclusion. She said the jury may have found, for  example, that Mr. Khill’s conduct increased the risk of a fatal confrontation  with Mr. Styres outside the home. They may also have assessed Mr. Khill’s decision to  advance into the darkness against other alternatives he could have taken, such  as calling 911, shouting from the window or turning on the lights. Those actions  may have prevented the mistaken belief that Mr. Styres was armed and  avoided the need to use deadly force. As a result, the majority concluded that a new trial is necessary to  ensure the jury is appropriately instructed on the principles of self-defence  and the significance of Mr. Khill’s role in the incident."
2021 SCC 34,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules an Ontario law that cut the number of Toronto city councillors  during the 2018 municipal election was constitutional. </strong>
  On May 1, 2018, a  municipal election campaign started in the City of Toronto. Candidate  nominations were due by July 27, 2018. Over 500 people registered as candidates.  On the day nominations closed, the government of Ontario announced its  intention to introduce a law to reduce the number of electoral wards from 47 to  25.  The law, known as the <em>Better Local Government Act, 2018</em>, came  into force on August 14, 2018. Soon after, the City challenged the law in court. It argued the law  violated the freedom of expression of candidates and voters, contrary to  section 2(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms</em>. It also argued the law violated certain unwritten constitutional  principles, such as democracy.  The Ontario Superior  Court agreed with the City. The Province of Ontario appealed that decision. In  the meantime, the election was held on October 22, 2018, with 25 wards only. Later,  the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Province. The City then appealed to  the Supreme Court of Canada.   The Supreme Court has agreed  with the Province.  <strong>The law did not violate the freedom of expression of candidates and  voters.</strong>
     Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Brown said the lawdid not stop candidates from expressing themselves: “The candidates and their  supporters had 69 days — longer than most federal and provincial election  campaigns — to re-orient their messages and freely express themselves according  to the new ward structure”.  The judges said the  law did not restrict what candidates could say or do. They noted many candidates had successful  campaigns, raised substantial amounts of money and won lots of votes. They said  this would not have been possible if candidates had been prevented from meaningful  expression. The majority recognized that some of the candidates’ messages, made  before the number of wards was reduced, may have lost their relevance. However,  they said section 2(b) of the <em>Charter</em> does not guarantee the effectiveness or relevance of messages or campaign  materials.  <strong>Unwritten constitutional principles cannot invalidate a law.  </strong>
     The majority said unwritten  constitutional principles, such as democracy, can be used to understand and  interpret the Constitution, but these principles cannot be used to invalidate laws.  <strong>The authority of provinces over  municipalities was not in dispute.  </strong>Section 92(8) of the Constitution allows provinces to pass laws affecting municipalities. That means the Province could change the number of wards at any time without consulting the City beforehand. This authority was not in dispute in this case. "
2021 SCC 33,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that courts of appeal have the authority to lift their own  publication bans after cases are closed.</strong>
   The Supreme Court of Canada was asked if the Manitoba Court of Appeal  could lift a publication ban it had previously issued in the case of Mr.  Stanley Frank Ostrowski. The question arose after the Canadian Broadcasting  Corporation (CBC) had asked to see a document covered by the ban.  Mr. Ostrowski was convicted of first-degree murder in 1987 and sentenced  to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. In 2009, Mr. Ostrowski  asked Manitoba’s Minister of Justice to review his conviction. Later that year,  he was released from prison pending the outcome of that review. By then, he had  served 23 years of his sentence.  In 2014, the Minister of Justice asked the Court of Appeal to decide if  there had been a miscarriage of justice at trial. During its proceedings, the  Court of Appeal ordered a publication ban on a sworn statement called an  affidavit, which Mr. Ostrowski wanted to submit as evidence. While the appeal  court did not accept the affidavit into evidence, it ordered the publication  ban to remain in effect indefinitely. In 2018, the appeal court found that a miscarriage of justice had indeed  occurred at Mr. Ostrowski’s 1987 trial. It said he did not have access to  important information that could have helped his defence at the time. As a  result, the appeal court set aside Mr. Ostrowski’s conviction.  In May 2019, the <abbr title=""Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"">CBC</abbr> asked the appeal court to lift the publication ban,  so that it could read the affidavit. The appeal court refused, on the basis  that it had already given its judgment in the case, so it no longer had  authority to reconsider the publication ban.  <strong>A</strong><strong>fter deciding a case, a court of appeal may reconsider a  publication ban in limited circumstances</strong>
     The Supreme Court has ruled courts of appeal may consider lifting their  own publication bans after the end of proceedings. Writing for the majority,  Justice Kasirer explained that a court cannot rehear a case after rendering its  judgment. This is called the doctrine of <em>functus  officio</em>. But afterwards, the court still has the authority to control  access to the court record. As a result, a court may reconsider a publication  ban made during the case. As Justice Kasirer said, even after the case comes to  an end, “important decisions about the openness of the court record may need to  be taken”.  This does not mean that a court of appeal may  reconsider a publication ban at any time or for any reason. It can do so in two  situations only: first, if there was a change in circumstances; or second, if  someone affected by the publication ban, such as the media, was not given  notice at the time of the ban.  In this case, Justice Kasirer said there were no change of  circumstances. But the Court of Appeal must still decide if the <abbr title=""Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"">CBC</abbr>’s request  meets the second condition. He referred the case back to the appeal court to do  so. <strong>Publication  ban </strong>
     A publication ban is an order that a court makes to prevent anyone from  publishing, broadcasting or transmitting information in a court file, to  protect either the evidence in the case or the identity of a victim, witness or  other person involved.  <strong>Court  proceedings are open and public</strong>  As  a general rule, court proceedings are open and public. This is known as the  open court principle, which is protected by the constitutional right to freedom  of expression. It is an essential feature of our democracy.  Given the importance of the open  court principle, publication bans apply in limited  circumstances only."
2021 SCC 32,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that a copyright tariff was not enforceable  against York University.</strong>
     From 1994  to 2010, York University (“York”) and Access Copyright (“Access”) had a licencing  agreement that allowed York professors to copy published works in Access’  collection in exchange for payments called royalties. Access is not the  copyright owner of the works, it is a collective society that administers  copyright protection on behalf of authors and publishers. By 2010, the royalties consisted of an annual fee of $3.38 per full-time  student in addition to $0.10 per page copied into a course pack for sale or  distribution to students. In 2010, York and Access were negotiating to renew the  agreement. As the licence expiry date approached, Access asked the Copyright  Board of Canada to set an interim tariff. The Copyright Board of Canada is the organisation  that sets the royalties to be paid for the use of copyrighted works, when the  copyright on such works are being administered collectively by a society. The  interim tariff took effect in January 2011 and York paid the royalties until  July 2011. It then stopped. York said that the interim tariff was not  enforceable and that it had the right to copy from Access’ collection without  paying, because of the “fair dealing” provisions in the <em>Copyright Act.</em> “Fair dealing” allows for copying of works without  requiring permission if done in the public interest. York said this includes copying for research and education. In 2013, Access asked the Federal Court to enforce the  interim tariff. It argued York’s copying was neither licenced, nor protected by  the fair dealing provisions. York responded by arguing that its copying was indeed  protected. The Federal Court ruled in favour of Access. York then turned to the  Federal Court of Appeal, which allowed York’s appeal on the enforcement of  tariffs but dismissed its appeal on fair dealing. Both parties then appealed to  the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. <strong>Tariffs approved  by Copyright Board are voluntary for users</strong>
     In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court concluded  that the tariff was not mandatory and York did not have to pay it. The judges said  the <em>Copyright Act</em> does not allow  Access to enforce royalties against York for any tariffs, interim or final, because  it chose not to be bound by the agreement. <strong>Protection  of users</strong>
     The collective administration provisions of the <em>Copyright Act</em> are intended to protect  users such as York. For example, these provisions provide a cap on the amount  that can be charged for a licence. But they do not allow a collective society  to force a licence on an unwilling user. That would be contrary to their  protective purpose. Users can always choose whether or not to accept a licence. <strong>Not an  infringement case</strong>
     If people accept a licence, but don’t pay the  royalties, they will be liable for defaulted payments. If they do not accept  the licence, they can be liable for copyright infringement but not for  defaulted payments. That is the case with York, because it did not accept the  licence. That means it cannot be liable for defaulted payments. The Court noted that this is not a case of copyright  infringement because Access could not make that claim. The only parties who  could make that claim are the authors and publishers who own the copyright. Without  the proper parties, the Court refused to address the fair dealing issue. "
2021 SCC 31,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that New Brunswick missed its  deadline to file a $50 million claim.</strong>
  In 2009, the Province of New  Brunswick agreed to guarantee $50 million in bank loans for a company called  Atcon, which provides construction, energy, industrial and waste management  services. The Province had agreed to act as a guarantor on the basis of a  report prepared by an auditing company called Grant Thornton. Atcon hired the  company to review its financial statements. The report from Grant Thornton  concluded that Atcon’s financial statements were accurate and were prepared  according to proper accounting principles. However, Atcon subsequently  defaulted on its bank loans and asked the Province to pay. It paid the entire $50  million in March 2010. In June 2010, the Province hired  another auditing company to review and report on Atcon’s finances. On February  4, 2011, the new auditors submitted a draft report stating that Atcon’s  finances had not been prepared according to proper accounting principles. The report  contained evidence that Atcon had overstated its assets, revenues and profits.  It also found Atcon had understated its liabilities, expenses and losses. The final  report, which was almost identical to the draft, was completed on November 30,  2012. On June 23, 2014, the Province filed  a $50 million claim against Grant Thornton, arguing that it had been negligent  in preparing its report of Atcon’s finances. Grant Thornton responded that it  had not been negligent and asked the judge to dismiss the claim, arguing that  the Province had run out of time to file it. Grant Thornton invoked the <em>Limitation of Actions Act</em>, a law in New  Brunswick that says a plaintiff has two years to file a claim after “discovering”  it. The judge sided with Grant Thornton, but the Court of Appeal sided with the  Province. The Supreme Court of Canada has agreed  with Grant Thornton. The Province filed its claim too late. <strong>When is a claim “discovered”?</strong>
     In a unanimous judgment, the  Supreme Court said a claim is “discovered” when the plaintiff has enough  information to know the defendant was probably at fault. In this case, the Court was satisfied  the Province had discovered the claim against Grant Thornton on February 4,  2011, the date it received the draft report. By then, the Province knew or  ought to have known a loss occurred that Grant Thornton had been hired to  detect. This was sufficient information to know Grant Thornton had been  negligent. Although the Province knew this on February 4, 2011, it did not  bring its claim until June 23, 2014, more than two years later. As a result,  the Court concluded that under New Brunswick’s <em>Limitation of Actions Act</em>, the Province had filed its claim too  late. <strong>Deadline for filing a claim </strong>Anyone filing a claim should  consider the deadlines that apply in their province or territory. Otherwise, they  risk losing the opportunity to have courts uphold their rights. "
2021 SCC 30,"<strong>The Supreme Court decides Canada North Group can pay expenses necessary  to its restructuring process before money owed to the Canada Revenue Agency.</strong>
   The <em>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act </em>is a law to help businesses avoid bankruptcy when a  company has more than $5 million in debt that it cannot afford to repay. The  process is called restructuring.  This could include giving a company more time to pay its debt, reducing its interest  costs or permitting it to borrow money to repay the debt. Companies that  restructure must hire experts such as interim lenders, monitors and lawyers. If  there is not enough money to pay everyone, a court will decide who gets paid  first. On July 5, 2017, an Alberta court ordered Canada North  Group, an Alberta company that provides remote workforce accommodations,  to pay its restructuring experts first. As a result, those expenses  became “super priority” charges. This meant the experts would be paid before  all other debts, including payroll deductions and GST owed to the federal government  (Crown). However, the Crown objected, asking that it be paid before  everyone else. When the court refused to change the order, the Crown turned  to the Alberta Court of Appeal, which dismissed its appeal. The federal  government asked the Supreme Court of Canada to consider the issue. Even though  there was enough money to pay everyone in this case, the Court decided to hear  it to determine the law. <strong>“Super  priority” for restructuring-related expenses</strong>
     A majority of the judges dismissed the Crown’s appeal.  They said a court supervising a restructuring process has the authority to order  that “super priority” charges be paid first, even before paying the  Crown the money it is owed. This is because the <em>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act</em> gives the court a broad  discretionary power to make any order that it considers appropriate in the  circumstances. For experts to put themselves at financial risk in order to  restructure a company, only to discover later that other creditors must be paid  first, would not be fair.  Four judges disagreed, saying that the money owed to  the Crown takes priority over all other debt or expenses, including the money  owed to the restructuring experts."
2021 SCC 29,"<strong>The Supreme Court decides  how “releases” should be interpreted.</strong> On March 3, 2009, Mrs. Bailey struck Mr. Temple while  driving her husband’s car. Mr. Temple, an employee of the City of Corner Brook  in Newfoundland and Labrador, was performing road work at the time. He sued Mrs.  Bailey for the injuries he sustained.<br/>
  Meanwhile, the Baileys sued the City for the damage to the  car and the injuries Mrs. Bailey sustained. On August 26, 2011, the Baileys  settled with the City and signed a “release”. The release stated that the  Baileys agreed to exempt the City from any past, present or future claims of any  kind related to the accident. In the years that followed, Mr. Temple’s lawsuit against Mrs.  Bailey continued. In that lawsuit, Mrs. Bailey filed a claim against the City,  in which she asked the judge to order the City to pay Mr. Temple for her, should  she be found responsible for his injuries. This is known as a third party  claim, because the City in this case was not a party to the lawsuit but was  being drawn into it. The City objected to the third party claim and argued the  release prevented Mrs. Bailey from trying to get the City to pay. The judge agreed  with the City. But on appeal, the Court of Appeal agreed with Mrs. Bailey. The  City then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court agreed with the City and allowed the  appeal. The Court concluded the release that Mrs. Bailey had signed prevented  her from making the third party claim against the City. <strong>A </strong><strong>“release” is a contract</strong>
     The Supreme  Court explained that a release is a contract and should be interpreted  according to general principles of contract law as set out in the Court’s  previous decision of <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14302/index.do"">Sattva  Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp</a></em>. These principles require courts  to give“<em>the words used [in a contract] their ordinary and grammatical meaning,  consistent with the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at the time  of formation of the contract</em>”. The surrounding circumstances consist only  of objective evidence of the facts at that time. It does not include the  subjective intentions of the parties, meaning what may have been going on in  their minds at the time. In this case, the judges noted that the release clearly  stated that Mrs. Bailey was giving up her rights against the City in “<em>all actions, suits, causes of action…  foreseen or unforeseen… and claims of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out  of or relating to the accident</em>”. The judges concluded that Mrs. Bailey’s  third party claim against the City came within the plain meaning of those  words. They also concluded that the surrounding circumstances of the case confirmed  that the parties, when signing the release, had objective knowledge of the  third party claim. <strong>Wording to consider</strong>When interpreting a  release, the question will be whether the release includes the type of claim filed.  Therefore, when drafting a release, a person might consider wording that makes  clear what claims the release will cover, including whether the release will  cover yet unknown claims. A release that is specific to a timeframe or subject matter  is less likely to cause disputes. "
2021 SCC 28,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that $30 million award to <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">Lac Seul</span> First Nation was not  enough compensation for flooded reserve land.</strong>
   Part of <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">Lac Seul</span> First  Nation (LSFN)’s reserve land in northern Ontario was flooded for a  hydroelectricity project that began in the 1920s. The project involved the  governments of Canada, Manitoba and Ontario. The project went ahead without the  consent of the LSFN and without compensation. The flooding caused major damage.  Years later, the <abbr title=""Lac Seul First Nation"">LSFN</abbr> brought a claim for that damage. The Federal Court ordered the government of  Canada to pay the LSFN $30 million in compensation. The judge considered the  value of the land in the 1920s but without the added value for the  hydroelectricity project.  The <abbr title=""Lac Seul First Nation"">LSFN</abbr> appealed to the  Federal Court of Appeal. The LSFN said that amount did not sufficiently  compensate them for the loss of the flooded land. The Federal Court of Appeal disagreed.  But the Supreme Court of  Canada agreed. It said $30 million did not sufficiently compensate the <abbr title=""Lac Seul First Nation"">LSFN</abbr>. It  therefore allowed the appeal. <strong>Damage to reserve land due to the hydroelectricity project </strong>
     The Supreme Court noted that  the hydroelectricity project caused major damage to the <abbr title=""Lac Seul First Nation"">LSFN</abbr> reserve land. A majority of the judges wrote that approximately “<em>17% of the LSFN Reserve — 11,304 acres or approximately 4,575 hectares — is  now permanently flooded. Homes were destroyed, as were wild rice fields,  gardens, haylands, and gravesites. Fishing, hunting, and trapping were all  impacted. The community was separated because one part of the reserve became an  island. And, despite the sacrifices suffered by the community to make the  hydroelectricity project possible, the reserve was not provided with  electricity until the 1980s.</em>”<strong>Assessment of equitable compensation </strong>
     The majority of judges said  the compensation amount should have included the added value for the  hydroelectricity project. They explained that the compensation  owed by Canada to the <abbr title=""Lac Seul First Nation"">LSFN</abbr> should be the amount that a properly negotiated deal  by Canada would have earned them. This meant a deal based on the value of the  land to those who were wanting to use it, which in this case was the  hydroelectricity project. The majority agreed with the LSFN that $30 million  was not enough to include that project and ordered that the Federal Court reassess  the amount. <strong>Canada’s <em>“fiduciary duty”</em> towards Indigenous Peoples  </strong>
     The majority explained  that Canada’s specific duty towards Indigenous Peoples is called a “fiduciary  duty”. Fiduciary duty means that Canada is obliged to act in the best interest  of Indigenous Peoples, especially as concerns reserve land. If that land is to  be taken away or damaged, as it was in this case, Canada must get the best price  for the land on their behalf. "
2021 SCC 27,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules it was  unconstitutional to raise the monetary value of cases that can be heard by the  Court of Québec.  </strong>
   The Supreme  Court of Canada was asked to decide if a change to the <em>Code of Civil Procedure</em> in Quebec infringed on the constitutionally  protected jurisdiction of superior courts. In 2016, the provincial government  changed article 35 of the <em>Code of Civil  Procedure</em> to raise the monetary value of cases that could be heard by the Court of Québec from any  amount under $70,000 to any amount under $85,000. The Court was also asked if certain  powers of the Court of Québec, pertaining to appeals of administrative decisions,  infringed on the powers of the Superior Court. Superior Court  judges in Quebec disagreed with the increase. They said that giving the Court  of Québec the exclusive power to hear cases involving amounts of less than  $85,000 violated section 96 of the Constitution. They argued that the Superior  Court should have retained the power to hear cases of $70,000 and above. They also contested  the appeal powers granted to the Court of Québec with respect to certain  administrative decisions. Quebec  eventually asked the Court of Appeal for an opinion on the matter, saying that  access to justice considerations had motivated it to increase the value of  cases that could be heard by the Court of Québec. It said there are often no  superior courts in small towns, and wanted to help people living outside of  major cities to access the courts without having to travel long distances. It  also argued that the appeal powers of the Court of Québec related to administrative  decisions did not infringe on the powers of the Superior Court. The Court of  Appeal concluded that article 35 was unconstitutional, but that the appeal powers  of the Court of Québec in administrative matters had no effect on those of the  Superior Court. The Supreme Court was then asked for its opinion on both  questions.  <strong>The court system in Canada </strong>
     The court system across Canada is  essentially the same. This is thanks to the Constitution, which divides provincial  and federal government powers. Each province has a three-level court system:  provincial (or lower) courts, superior courts, and appeal courts.  The Constitution  recognizes that provinces are responsible for administering justice in their  respective jurisdictions. This includes organizing and maintaining the civil  and criminal provincial courts, as well as civil procedure in those courts.  Section 96 of the Constitution mentions  special types of courts in Canada, known as the “superior courts”. These courts  are the highest courts in a province and benefit from a special protected status.  In Quebec, the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal are the “superior  courts”. The federal government has a certain amount of power over those  courts. For instance, the federal government is responsible for appointing superior  court judges.  <strong>The Supreme Court’s answers to the questions</strong>
     On the first  question, the majority of the judges concluded that article 35 was  unconstitutional.  They noted  that when the Constitutionwas  enacted in 1867, the monetary ceiling for lower courts was $100. Based on expert  evidence, they agreed that this amount would be equivalent to between $63,698  and $66,008, Canada-wide, today. However, they said that establishing this  amount is only a first step in the analysis, and that a determination on  whether the new ceiling amount was actually too high depended on several other  factors. The majority concluded that the monetary increase gave the Court of  Québec the exclusive jurisdiction to handle too wide a range of legal matters.  This, they said, prevented the Superior Court from exercising its  constitutionally protected right to decide on many legal matters at the heart  of Quebec private law.  As such, the  majority concluded the monetary ceiling of less than $85,000 was too high for  the Court of Québec. They also said the provincial government failed to prove  that access to justice was facilitated by the increase in the monetary ceiling  for cases heard by the Court of Québec.   The Supreme  Court did not answer the second question. It said it was irrelevant given its recent  decision in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2019/37748-eng.aspx"">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em> and given the  effects of a recent Quebec law which limits how the Court of Québec exercises  its appeal powers over administrative decisions. "
2021 SCC 26,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that Criminal  Code changes to the jury selection process are constitutional.</strong>
     This ruling  has important implications for the jury selection process. The Supreme Court  was asked to decide if changes to the <em>Criminal  Code</em> were constitutional. The changes in question abolished the long-standing  practice of allowing the Crown (prosecution) and the accused to exclude a  certain number of potential jurors without having to explain why. The rejection  of a juror in this way was called a “<em>peremptory  challenge</em>”. The <em>Criminal Code</em> continues to allow “<em>challenges for cause</em>”,  which allow the exclusion of potential jurors for specific reasons.  The reason  that Parliament chose to abolish peremptory challenges was to address  discrimination in the jury selection process. When the proposed changes were  introduced to Parliament, the Minister of Justice said that peremptory  challenges give both the accused and the Crown the ability to exclude jurors  without reason, and in practice, “<em>this  can and has led to their use in a discriminatory manner to ensure a jury of a  particular composition.</em>”  The  amendments to the law that eliminated peremptory challenges came into effect on  September 19, 2019. That was also the day that jury selection began in the  first degree murder trial of Mr. Pardeep Singh Chouhan.  Before his trial began, Mr. Chouhan raised  his objection to the abolition of peremptory challenges, claiming it was  unconstitutional, and even if it was constitutional, it should not apply to his  trial.  He claimed that the abolition  of peremptory challenges violated his rights to an independent and impartial jury  trial under sections 11(d) and 11(f) of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>(the <em>Charter</em>).  However, the trial judge decided that the abolition of peremptory  challenges was constitutional. Jury selection proceeded without peremptory  challenges and Mr. Chouhan was eventually found guilty of first degree murder.  Mr. Chouhan  appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal. It found the amendments to the <em>Criminal Code</em> constitutional, but it  ruled that some of those changes should not have applied to people who had a  jury trial pending when the amendments came into force. The Ontario Court of  Appeal overturned Mr. Chouhan’s conviction and ordered a new trial.  The Crown appealed  to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that peremptory challenges should be  abolished for jury selections starting on or after September 19, 2019, and as  such, Mr. Chouhan was not entitled to them. Mr. Chouhan also appealed to the  Supreme Court, arguing as he did before the Ontario Court of Appeal that the  abolition of peremptory challenges was unconstitutional.  <strong>The abolition of peremptory challenges is constitutional </strong>
     The majority  of the judges of the Supreme Court said the constitutionality of the jury  selection process must be considered as a whole. They reviewed the process as  it stands now given the amendments made by Parliament when it introduced the  law that led to the abolition of peremptory challenges.  The majority said the jury  selection process continues to guarantee the right of each accused to a fair  trial before an independent and impartial jury.  They noted that protections  begin long before the day on which the accused appears in court to select the  jury. They also emphasized that provincial authorities are constantly at work,  compiling a representative jury roll of eligible jurors, as part of a process  that provides a fair opportunity for a broad cross‑section of society to serve  as a juror.As such, the majority of the  judges of the Supreme Court concluded that the abolition of peremptory  challenges was constitutional.  <strong>The amendments abolishing peremptory  challenges should apply from September 19, 2019 </strong>  The majority of the judges  determined the amendments should apply to all jury selections starting on or  after September 19, 2019. They explained that a procedural amendment that affects  how a right is exercised could be applied immediately.  As a result, the Supreme Court  restored Mr. Chouhan’s conviction. "
2021 SCC 25,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that the sealing orders on the estate  files of Toronto couple Barry and Honey Sherman were unjustified. </strong>
   Today’s decision means the media  may access the files that establish who would inherit the money and assets of  the couple who police say were murdered in December 2017.  The Sherman Estate had sought  sealing orders to block public access to estate files. It wanted the  individuals concerned to be spared from further intrusion into their privacy  and protected from what they allege was a risk to their safety. The sealing  orders were initially granted, but challenged by a journalist and the Toronto  Star newspaper. They said the sealing orders violated their constitutional  rights of freedom of expression and freedom of the press, as well as the  principle that courts should be open to the public. The Ontario Superior Court  of Justice upheld the sealing orders. The journalist and the Toronto Star appealed  the decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which overturned that decision and  set aside the sealing orders.  <strong>The open court principle</strong>
     As a general rule, court  proceedings are open and public, including estate files. This is known as the  open court principle, and is protected by the constitutional right to freedom  of expression. It is an essential feature of our democracy.  The Supreme Court said there is a  strong presumption in favour of open courts. It noted that this “<em>allows for public scrutiny which can be the  source of inconvenience and even embarrassment to those who feel that their  engagement in the justice system brings intrusion into their private lives. But  this discomfort is not, as a general matter, enough to overturn the strong  presumption that the public can attend hearings and that court files can be  consulted and reported upon by the free press.</em>”<strong>Was the dignity or safety of the individuals at risk? </strong>
     The Supreme Court noted that privacy  concerns can justify a sealing order if the dignity of the individuals in  question is at risk. It said the Sherman Estate had to prove that the  information in the court file is “<em>sufficiently  sensitive such that it can be said to strike at the biographical core of the  individual and, in the broader circumstances, that there is a serious risk  that, without an exceptional order, the affected individual will suffer an  affront to their dignity</em>”.  The Court found that the  information in the court fileswas  not ofsuch a highly sensitive nature.  It said the Sherman Estatefailed to  show how lifting the sealing orders would affect the dignity of the individuals.  It also said the safety of the individuals was not at serious risk.  The Supreme Court concluded that the  sealing orders were properly set aside by the Court of Appeal.  "
2021 SCC 24,"<strong>The Supreme Court rejects  parent’s bid to reduce or cancel $170,000 child support debt.</strong>
   The parties were married in 1983 and divorced  in 1996. The mother was awarded sole custody of the couple’s two daughters, and  the father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $115 per child on  a weekly basis.  For 16 years, the father failed to make any  voluntary child support payments, did not disclose his income, and moved to two  different countries without notifying the mother. His obligation to pay child  support ended in 2012, but by that time, he owed the mother almost $170,000 in  unpaid child support.  In 2016, the father sought to have his child  support debt cancelled or substantially reduced. He applied under section 17 of  the <em>Divorce Act</em>, which allows a payor  parent to apply to retroactively decrease an order for child support. He asked the  court to retroactively change the child support amount, and to establish it  based on the <em>Federal Child Support  Guidelines</em> (<em>Guidelines</em>), which  came into effect in 1997. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice agreed, and it reduced  the amount of unpaid child support the father owed to approximately $42,000.  The mother appealed that decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which  overturned the lower court decision and ordered the father to pay his original  debt of $170,000. The father appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  <strong>Framework for courts to follow </strong>
     This case gave the Supreme Court the  opportunity to establish a framework for courts to follow when a parent tries  to retroactively decrease child support to reflect a past reduction in income  under section 17 of the <em>Divorce Act</em>.  The Supreme Court noted that family law matters  are diverse and complex and that courts need wide discretion to come to a fair  result. It said courts must balance a child’s need for regular and appropriate support  with the need for flexibility when a parent’s ability to pay is affected by  changes in income over time.  The framework recognizes two long-established principles  of Canadian child support law. First, children have a right to a fair standard  of support. That is a core objective of the <em>Guidelines</em>.  Secondly, parents are obliged to financially support their children starting at  birth and continuing after separation. The  Supreme Court also explained that since the <em>Guidelines </em>came into effect,the payor  parent is under a free-standing legal obligation — independent of any court  order — to pay child support in line with their income.  The Supreme Court stressed the  child support system depends on adequate, accurate and timely financial  disclosure. It said “<em>frank disclosure of income  information by the payor lies at the foundation of the child support regime</em>”.   <strong>Principle of  retroactive decrease applied to this case </strong>
     In this  case, the father tried to seek a retroactive decrease of child support payments  back to 1997, claiming that he was automatically entitled to it, even though he  never notified the mother about his decreased income at the time.  The  Supreme Court noted that a parent who has established a past decrease in income  is not automatically entitled to a retroactive decrease of support to the date  of the decrease. It emphasized that it is up to the court to make a  discretionary decision based on its analysis of the specific circumstances of  the given case.  The Court said the father failed to communicate  or seek a change of the support order for 18 years. It said “<em>he made few, if any, voluntary payments  during that time and showed no willingness to support his children, who suffered  hardship as a result of his failure to fulfill his obligations. His conduct  shows bad faith efforts to evade the enforcement of a court order</em>”. In this unanimous decision, all judges of the  Supreme Court agreed that the father was not entitled to a reduction in child  support based on decreased income. Further, they said his failure to produce  adequate evidence of his financial circumstances was fatal to any attempt to  cancel his child support debt. The Court concluded that the father had not  proved that he could not pay now or in the future, even with a flexible payment  plan. In any event, the Court said the cancellation of child support debt would  only happen in exceptional cases and as a last resort. The payment and  enforcement of a child support debt is the rule.  As a result of the Court’s decision, the father  will be required to pay the mother the child support owed, approximately  $170,000. "
2021 SCC 23,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules a Quebec media company may not access court documents that  had been filed, and then removed, from a civil lawsuit once proceedings ended.</strong>
   This case involves the company MediaQMI Inc., which  publishes the Journal de Montréal newspaper. The news outlet wanted to publish  details about a case involving Mr. Magdi Kamel and his former employer, the  <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux de l’Ouest‑de‑l’Île‑de‑Montréal</span> (CIUSSS). The <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">CIUSSS</span> had sued its former manager, Mr. Kamel, claiming he had  misappropriated approximately $400,000 of its money by channeling it into four  different bank accounts over several years. It also asked the court to issue an  order to learn who owned the four bank accounts. Among the documents the <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">CIUSSS</span> filed with the court to support its case was a forensic accounting report. The  Quebec Superior Court agreed to order the identification of the bank account  holder or holders. It also ordered the entire court record be sealed.  MediaQMI subsequently asked the Quebec Superior  Court to unseal the documents so it could access the court record and its  exhibits. However, before a judge could decide that issue, the <abbr title=""Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux""><span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">CIUSSS</span></abbr> dropped  the lawsuit. As such, there was no trial, and both the <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">CIUSSS</span> and Mr. Kamel  sought to retrieve documents from the court record. Yet MediaQMI objected to  the <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">CIUSSS</span>’s efforts to remove its exhibits. The Quebec Superior Court judge  who ruled on the matter ordered the unsealing of the court records, but said  that because the lawsuit had ended, the parties could retrieve their exhibits  and shield them from the public. MediaQMI appealed to the Quebec Court of  Appeal and lost. It then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  <strong>Does the public still have access to exhibits once parties have  retrieved them from the court record?  </strong>
     The main question for the Supreme Court was whether  the public can still have access to exhibits in court records once a lawsuit  has ended and the parties have removed their exhibits from the court record. In Quebec, the <em>Code of Civil Procedure</em> gives any member  of the public the right to access court records. The <em>Code of Civil Procedure</em> also  contains a provision dealing with the removal of exhibits filed in a court  record. During proceedings, parties may withdraw their exhibits if all of them  consent. Once the proceedings have ended, parties have one year to retrieve  their exhibits. If they do not, the exhibits may be destroyed. The majority of the judges of the Supreme Court of  Canada has upheld the finding of the Court of Appeal. They said that once  parties retrieve their exhibits at the end of a proceeding, members of the  public may continue to consult court records, but will no longer have access to  exhibits that have been removed.  The Supreme Court also emphasized that the general  rule is that court proceedings and records are open and public."
2021 SCC 22,"<strong>The Supreme  Court finds that five Toronto-area churchgoers have no legal basis to ask the  courts to restore their voluntary church membership. </strong>
   Five Toronto-area churchgoers sued their former church, the Ethiopian  Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Canada St. Mary Cathedral, for having expelled them  from the congregation. This followed the Church having appointed them as part  of a committee to investigate a movement within the congregation that was said  to go against its beliefs. When the committee concluded its investigation, it made  recommendations to the senior leadership of the Church. However, the Archbishop  and other senior leaders of the Church did not follow the committee’s  recommendations. The five churchgoers voiced their dissatisfaction, and in the  end, the Church decided to expel them. They took the Church to court over this  and asked to be reinstated.   The Superior  Court of Ontario dismissed their case, stating that there was no legal issue  requiring a trial. In so doing, the judge referred to a Supreme Court of Canada  case from 2018 – <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/37273-eng.aspx"">Highwood  Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses (Judicial Committee) v. Wall</a></em> – which  found that membership decisions of religious associations are not subject to  review by a court if there is no underlying legal right at issue. In order for  a court to review the internal procedures of a voluntary association like a  church, there needs to be an actual legal right at issue, such as a contractual  dispute to resolve between the parties.  The Court of Appeal noted that the five churchgoers had completed  membership forms to join the Church and made monthly voluntary contributions  and the Church had a constitution and bylaws. On the basis of its assessment of  this evidence, the Court of Appeal granted the appeal, finding that the bond  between the Church and the churchgoers was in fact a contractual one. The Court  of Appeal ordered a trial to determine if the Church had breached the contract.  The Church appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.  <strong>No contract between the Church and the  churchgoers </strong>
     Canada’s highest court said the Court of Appeal made an error in  finding that a contract was formed between the Church and the churchgoers. It  noted that many informal agreements that people undertake do not necessarily result  in a contract. An essential component for the formation of a contract was  missing in this case, which was the intention to create legal rights and obligations  towards one another.  In this unanimous decision, the judges of the Supreme Court noted that in  the pursuit of common goals, many voluntary associations have rules, and  sometimes even a constitution, bylaws and a governing body to adopt and apply  the rules. These are practical measures to help in the pursuit of shared objectives.  But, they do not in and of themselves give rise to contractual relationships  between the individuals who join. To illustrate their point, the judges said: “<em>the members of the local minor hockey  league, or a group formed to oppose development of green spaces, or a bible  study group, for example, do not enter into enforceable legal obligations just  because they have joined a group with rules that members are expected to  follow.</em>”
     Joining a congregation or voluntary association and  making financial contributions does not in itself form a  legally binding relationship. "
2021 SCC 20,"<strong>Supreme Court clarifies link  between consent and capacity to consent in a sexual assault case.</strong>
   G.F. and R.B.  were charged with sexually assaulting a 16‑year‑old during a camping trip. The  issue at trial was whether the teenager who had consumed alcohol, had consented  to sexual activity with the two adults. The victim and G.F. both testified and  presented opposite versions of events. R.B. did not testify. The Crown  prosecutor argued that the teenager’s evidence clearly established incapacity  due to intoxication and also that she had not agreed to the sexual activity.  G.F. and R.B. claimed that the 16-year-old had not been as intoxicated as she  claimed, and that she had agreed to engage in the sexual activity. The trial judge  convicted G.F. and R.B of sexual assault. G.F. and  R.B. appealed the convictions to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The Court of  Appeal agreed that based on the evidence, the verdict was reasonable. However,  the Court of Appeal said the trial judge should have explained the factors he  considered when assessing if the teenager was too intoxicated to consent. The Court  of Appeal also found that the trial judge failed to consider consent first and  independently from the question of capacity to consent. As a result, the Court  of Appeal concluded that a new trial was necessary for both G.F and R.B. The Crown  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  <strong>Consent and capacity are inseparable </strong>
     The majority  of the Supreme Court judges noted that this appeal gave the Court an  opportunity to clarify the relationship between consent, and the capacity to  give consent.  Consent is  the foundation of Canada’s sexual assault laws. The majority of the judges said  that consent and the capacity to give consent are inseparable. They explained  that consent to sexual activity requires someone to be capable of consenting  before giving their consent. The majority stated that trial judges are not  obliged to evaluate consent and capacity separately or in any particular order.  In this case, the majority said the trial judge made no mistakes in finding the  teenager was incapable of consenting and that she never agreed to the sexual  activity. The majority also found that the trial judge made no mistake when he  addressed the two questions together in his reasons.  Capacity is a  precondition to being able to consent. Capacity to consent requires that people  have a mind capable of understanding the physical act, its sexual nature, the  specific identity of their partner, as well as the choice of whether or not to  engage in the sexual activity in question. <strong>Trial judge’s reasons were sufficient </strong>
     The majority  found the trial judge’s reasons were sufficient and that the Court of Appeal had  assessed the trial judge’s reasons in a way that was removed from the context  of the issues at trial.  The majority concluded that the trial judge’s blending of consent and  capacity revealed neither an error in law nor insufficient reasons. Capacity  was not the only issue at trial, and the trial judge’s reasons can be read as  finding both that the complainant was incapable of consenting and that she did  not agree to the sexual activity. The majority said that these findings were  not legally contradictory and both were available conclusions on the basis of  the evidence. "
2021 SCC 19,"<strong>Denying young offenders an automatic  right to appeal to the Supreme Court is constitutional. The Supreme Court  upholds a teenager’s sexual assault conviction because the teenaged victim was  too intoxicated to consent to sexual activity.</strong>
   Today’s  judgment stems from a Toronto-area beach party, where a 15-year-old boy  sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl. After being found guilty of sexual  assault, the boy known as C.P. because he is a young offender, appealed to the  Ontario Court of Appeal. He claimed the verdict was unreasonable based on the  evidence. C.P. lost his appeal, but one of the three judges disagreed with  their colleagues on a point of law.  Adults  convicted of such serious crimes under the <em>Criminal  Code</em> and who lose their appeals have the automatic right to appeal to  Canada’s highest court when the judges at the Court of Appeal disagree on a  point of law. That is not the case for  offenders convicted of such crimes under the <em>Youth Criminal Justice Act</em> (<em>YCJA</em>).  In his appeal, C.P. challenged section 37(10) of the <em>YCJA</em>. He claimed it violates the rights of young offenders under  the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms </em>(the <em>Charter</em>).  <strong>The constitutional  argument</strong>
     In his  appeal, C.P. asked the Supreme Court of Canada to overturn the guilty verdict  and to decide if section 37(10) of the <em>YCJA</em> violated his section 7 and 15 <em>Charter</em> rights. Section 7 protects  an individual’s right to life, liberty and security. Section 15 of the <em>Charter</em> protects groups from  discrimination, including on the basis of age. The Court agreed to answer both  questions.  <strong>The verdict was reasonable</strong>
     A majority of Supreme Court  judges agreed with the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal that the verdict  was reasonable. They found that the trial judge provided solid reasons for what  she believed happened on the night of the sexual assault. The majority said the  trial judge’s reasons for finding C.P. guilty were rigorous and thoughtfully  explained.  <strong>Section 37(10) of the Youth  Criminal Justice Act is constitutional</strong>
     The majority of the judges of  the Supreme Court also found that section 37(10) of the <em>YCJA</em> is constitutional. Five judges explained that the <em>YCJA</em> did not violate C.P.’s section 7  Charter rights because the modern youth justice system recognizes the  vulnerability of young offenders with greater and more tailored protections in  line with their unique circumstances. Four judges found that section  37(10) did not breach C.P.’s section 15 <em>Charter </em>rights. They said that Parliament did not discriminate against young people  when it passed the <em>YCJA</em>. The judges  found the law balances the benefits of review on appeal against the  harms inherent in that process, such as the principle that there should be no  unnecessary delays in the final outcome of criminal trials.  One judge found that section 37(10) had breached C.P.’s section 15 <em>Charter</em> rights. However, he concluded that  the violation was reasonable under section 1 of the <em>Charter</em>, which says rights can be limited, if reasonable and  justified in a free and democratic society. This judge reasoned that in C.P.’s  case, the limit was justified because it served the goal of timely justice and  young people may still appeal to the Supreme Court with permission. "
2021 SCC 18,"<strong>The Supreme Court of Canada rules that  police officers cannot sue Crown prosecutors for decisions they make about how  to conduct a criminal case. </strong>
     Three Toronto  police officers arrested two individuals in connection with a complaint of  armed robbery and forcible confinement. Prior to trial, one of the accused men filed  an application to stay (stop) the proceedings against him and to exclude the evidence  of a confession he made on the day of the arrest. This was based on his claim  that the police beat him during the arrest and caused a serious rib injury. The  Assistant Crown Attorney and a senior Crown Attorney agreed that the confession  would not be admissible, and the charges against him were stayed. The other  accused was convicted, but he filed a stay application alleging that the  officers assaulted him during the arrest. The Assistant Crown Attorney did not  call the officers to give evidence and conceded that the assaults occurred. The  judge convicted him but reduced the sentence. Her reasons described the  assaults in detail and described the officers’ conduct as “police brutality”.  Those findings were reported in the media. The Toronto Police Service  Professional Standards Unit then conducted its own review of the allegations of  misconduct against the officers, concluding that the allegations could not be  substantiated. The Court of Appeal entered a stay of proceedings. It strongly  criticized the officers’ conduct. Its findings were also reported in the media.  After the  appeal, the officers filed a lawsuit against the Attorney General. They claimed  to have suffered irreparable harm to their reputations and credibility as a  result of the Crown attorneys’ decisions not to call their evidence. This is  the first time the Supreme Court has had a chance to consider whether the  police can sue Crown prosecutors for the way they conduct a case.  The concept  of “prosecutorial immunity” means Crown prosecutors generally cannot be sued  for actions they take in performing their public duties. There is an exception  for a person who is wrongfully and maliciously prosecuted.  The majority of the judges  concluded that prosecutors do not owe legal duties to the police with respect  to how they carry out a prosecution. Piercing the immunity of Crown prosecutors  to make them accountable to police officers would put them in conflict with  their duties of objectivity, independence and integrity in pursuit of ensuring  a fair trial for the accused and maintaining public confidence in the  administration of justice. The need to safeguard and vindicate the rights of the  accused, who is uniquely vulnerable to the misuse of prosecutorial power, is  crucial. Allowing police officers to sue prosecutors for decisions they make in  the course of criminal proceedings would create risks to the rights of the  accused and to prosecutorial independence and objectivity, and would undermine  the integrity of the criminal justice system. It would also be fundamentally  incompatible with the mutually independent relationship between the police and  the prosecutor. The police’s role is to investigate crime; the Crown  prosecutor’s role is to assess whether a prosecution is in the public interest  and, if so, to carry out that prosecution in accordance with the prosecutor’s  duties to the administration of justice and the accused.

2021 SCC 17,"<strong>The Supreme Court of  Canada rules that non-citizens and non-residents can claim an Aboriginal right  under the Constitution.</strong>
     Mr. Richard Lee Desautel, an  American citizen, shot and killed an elk without a hunting license in the Arrow  Lakes region in British Columbia in October 2010. He is a member of the Lakes  Tribe of the Colville Confederated Tribes and lives on reserve in Washington State.  He was charged with hunting without a license and hunting big game  while not being a resident of British Columbia. Mr. Desautel admitted that he  shot the elk, but argued that he was exercising his Aboriginal right to hunt in  the traditional territory of his Sinixt ancestors under section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> (Canadian Constitution).   He claimed that the Lakes Tribe is a  successor group to the Sinixt people whose traditional territory included an  area in what is now British Columbia. The place where he shot the elk was  within this territory.  The central question for the Supreme Court was whether people who are  not Canadian citizens, and who do not reside in Canada, can exercise an  Aboriginal right that is protected under the Canadian Constitution.  <strong>“Aboriginal Peoples of  Canada” </strong>
     The case revolved around the definition of “Aboriginal peoples of  Canada” found in Section 35 of the Canadian Constitution, which recognizes  and affirms existing Aboriginal and treaty rights.  This was the first time the  Court had interpreted the words “Aboriginal peoples of Canada”. The majority of the judges of  the Supreme Court said a fundamental purpose of section 35 was to recognize the  prior occupation of Canada by organized, autonomous Aboriginal societies.  The majority said that “Aboriginal  peoples of Canada” means the modern-day successors of Aboriginal societies that  occupied Canadian territory at the time of European contact, even if such  societies are now located outside Canada. Excluding Aboriginal peoples who  moved or were forced to move, or whose territory was divided by a border, would  add to the injustice of colonialism. They concluded that groups whose  members are neither citizens nor residents of Canada can be considered part of  the “Aboriginal peoples of Canada” and claim an Aboriginal right under section  35.  <strong>Can the group in  question be considered part of the “Aboriginal peoples of Canada”? </strong>
     The majority of the judges then considered  whether the specific group that Mr. Desautel belonged to could be considered part  of the “Aboriginal peoples of Canada”.  They noted that when it comes to  Aboriginal claims, the trial judge is typically best suited to assess the  evidence as it is presented. The majority accepted the trial judge’s finding that  that Mr. Desautel’s group, the Lakes Tribe, is a successor group of the Sinixt  people. At the time of contact between the Sinixt and Europeans, their territory  extended into what is now British Columbia (to the north), and into what is now  Washington State (to the south).  An international border was  created in 1846, and by 1872, a number of members of the Sinixt were living for  the most part in Washington State, but continued to travel to British Columbia  for hunting purposes.  The majority agreed that moving  to live in the American part of their ancestral territory did not prevent the  Lakes Tribe from being a successor group to the Sinixt. As such, they found  that the Lakes Tribe could be considered part of the “Aboriginal peoples of  Canada” under section 35 of the Canadian Constitution.  <strong>Does  the group have Aboriginal rights under section 35 of the Constitution? </strong>
  Having established  that the group is part of the “Aboriginal peoples of Canada”, the majority then  had to determine if the group had Aboriginal rights under section 35. They explained  that the test to determine the existence of rights is the same for groups  outside Canada as for groups in Canada.  A critical element of the test was  whether the claimed modern right, the right to hunt in this case, was a  continuation of a historical practice that existed prior to European contact.  The majority agreed with the  trial judge that the claimed right was a continuation of a historical practice.  They also agreed that apart from  periods in which no hunting took place, there was no significant difference  between the pre-contact practice and the modern one.  As a result, the  majority agreed that Mr. Desautel was exercising an Aboriginal right and had  been properly acquitted of all charges by the trial judge. "
2021 SCC 11,"<strong>The Supreme Court of Canada rules the federal  carbon pricing law is constitutional. </strong>
   Parliament passed the <em>Greenhouse  Gas Pollution Pricing Act</em> in 2018, based on the consensus that greenhouse  gas emissions contribute to global climate change. Countries around the world  committed to drastically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 Paris  Agreement. In Canada, the federal government passed the Act to implement its commitments.  Specifically, the law required provinces and territories to implement carbon  gas pricing systems by January 1, 2019 or adopt one imposed by the federal  government. <strong>Why is the federal Act constitutional? </strong>
     Chief Justice Richard Wagner wrote for the majority of the judges,  which found the Act to be constitutional. They noted that global warming causes  harm beyond provincial boundaries and that it is a matter of national concern  under the “<em>peace, order and good  government” </em>clause of the Constitution<em>.</em>  The majority noted  the Act would only apply where provincial or territorial pricing systems are  not strict enough to reduce global warming.  <strong>A rarely applied doctrine of Canadian  constitutional law </strong>
     The majority noted that national concern is a well-established but  rarely applied doctrine of Canadian constitutional law. The application of this  doctrine is strictly limited in order to maintain the autonomy of the provinces  and respect the diversity of confederation. However, the federal government has  the authority to act in appropriate cases, where there is a matter of genuine national  concern and where the recognition of that matter is consistent with the  division of powers.  <strong>Federalism </strong>
     The Constitution divides federal and provincial powers. The majority of  judges observed that Canada, which has a federal system of governance, requires  a balance between federal and provincial powers. They recalled that this  concept, known as federalism, is a foundational principle of Canada’s Constitution.  <strong>Not a tax </strong>
     The majority noted that the term “carbon tax” is often used to describe  the pricing of carbon emissions. However, they said this has nothing to do with  the concept of taxation, as understood in the constitutional context. As such,  they also concluded that the fuel and excess emission charges imposed by the Act  were constitutionally valid regulatory charges and not taxes.  <strong>How did the case get to the Supreme  Court? </strong>
     Three provinces – Saskatchewan, Ontario and Alberta – challenged the  constitutionality of the Act by referring the legislation to their respective  courts of appeal. The courts of appeal for Saskatchewan and Ontario found the Act  constitutional, while the Alberta Court of Appeal found it unconstitutional.  The question for the Supreme Court was whether the federal government had  the authority to pass such a law that puts a price on carbon.  <strong>What were the main arguments?</strong>
     The provinces said they had their own climate policies, tailored to  their own circumstances. They also argued that they have jurisdiction over  natural resources.  For its part, the federal government argued that it has the authority  to address issues that are national in scope. It also maintained that the law  was a backstop (or safety net) to ensure minimum carbon pricing standards  across the country.   <strong>Climate change is real </strong>
     The Supreme Court also pointed out that all of the  parties agree that global climate change is real. It’s caused by greenhouse gas  emissions resulting from human activities and it poses a grave threat to the  future of humanity. "
2021 SCC 10,"<strong>The  Supreme Court has provided guidance to appellate courts  on inconsistent jury verdicts. </strong>
   This case deals with the concept of  inconsistent verdicts given by a jury. This happens when a jury finds an  accused person both guilty and not guilty of the same conduct. The Supreme  Court of Canada clarified the approach to be taken by appellate courts when  verdicts are alleged to be inconsistent.  The accused, R.V., was charged with sexual  offences against an underage person between 1995 and 2003. Specifically, he was  charged with sexual assault, sexual interference and invitation to sexual  touching. The jury convicted R.V. of sexual interference and invitation to  sexual touching. The same jury found him not guilty of sexual assault based on  the same evidence. R.V. appealed his convictions. He claimed the guilty  verdicts were unreasonable because they were inconsistent with the not guilty  verdict. The Crown (prosecution) cross-appealed the not guilty verdict,  claiming the instructions to the jury were so unnecessarily confusing that it  amounted to an error of law.  A majority of the Court of Appeal for  Ontario found that the convictions for sexual interference and invitation to sexual  touching were unreasonable because they were inconsistent with the not guilty  verdict on the sexual assault charge. It also concluded there was no legal  error in the instructions to the jury. Therefore, the majority set aside the  convictions and substituted not guilty verdicts. The prosecution appealed the  case to the Supreme Court of Canada.  A majority of the judges of the Supreme  Court of Canada set out a framework to analyze cases where an accused person  alleges that verdicts are inconsistent. The majority wrote that in some cases,  the prosecution can try to reconcile verdicts that appear to be inconsistent if  they were the result of a legal error in the instructions to the jury.  In explaining the framework, the majority  said that the burden is on the prosecution to satisfy an appellate court to a  high degree of certainty that there was a legal error in the instructions to  the jury and that the error: (1) had an impact on the not guilty verdict; (2)  did not have an impact on the guilty verdict; and (3) demonstrates that the  jury did not find the accused guilty and not guilty of the same conduct.  Applying the framework to the facts before  them, the majority found that the trial judge had misdirected the jury on the  charge of sexual assault, which was a legal error. Specifically, the trial  judge left the members of the jury with the mistaken impression that the  element of “force” required for sexual assault was different than the element  of “touching” required for sexual interference and invitation to sexual  touching. The majority then found, to a high degree of certainty, that the  legal error: (1) had a significant impact on the not guilty verdict of sexual  assault; (2) did not have an impact on the guilty verdicts; and (3) demonstrated  that the jury did not actually find R.V. guilty and not guilty of the same  conduct, because the jury had not been given the right explanation of what  “force” meant. As a result  of its analysis, the majority concluded that the verdicts were not actually  inconsistent and therefore not unreasonable. The majority reinstated the guilty  verdicts. It also set aside the not guilty verdict on the charge of sexual  assault and entered a “stay of proceedings” on that charge. This means the criminal  process was stopped instead of ordering a new trial. "
2021 SCC 9,"<strong>The Supreme Court has ruled that jury selection errors can be  remedied if certain requirements are met.   </strong>
   In 2015, Mr. Esseghaier and Mr. Jaser were found guilty of terrorism  offenses in connection with a series of plots designed to kill people. A judge  sentenced them both to life in prison with potential availability of parole  after serving 10 years from the date of their arrest. They appealed their  conviction. The Court of Appeal for Ontario overturned their convictions and  ordered a new trial. It found that the jury had not been chosen  correctly, in accordance with the rules governing jury selection. The Crown  (prosecution) appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada.  Mr. Esseghaier and Mr. Jaser chose  to be tried by a jury. In Canada, a jury is a group of 12 people (jurors) who  decide if a person charged with a criminal offence is guilty or not guilty. The  members of the jury are chosen randomly from a group of regular people who have  been asked to report for jury duty. That group is called the jury panel.  The prosecutor or the defence  lawyer may challenge members of the jury panel if they feel someone might not  be fair-minded. This is called a “challenge for cause” and can be used to  exclude people from the jury based on their responses to questions.  Before the trial, Mr. Jaser’s lawyer requested a “challenge for cause” to find out if any potential  juror might not be fair-minded as a result of having read pre-trial news  reports, or because the two accused men are members of visible  minorities and Muslim.  At the time, the <em>Criminal Code</em> outlined  two separate systems for determining if a potential juror was biased, both of  which relied on people known as “triers”, whose job was to decide whether each  potential juror was fair-minded or not.   One way to decide if someone on  the panel was biased was by using “rotating triers”. That’s when the judge would  choose two people to serve as deciders until the first juror was chosen (being  chosen would mean that the deciders believed the person to be fair-minded). The  first juror would then replace one of two deciders (who would be sent home).  This process would continue, with the newly selected jurors replacing the  existing triers, until the entire jury had been selected. With this “rotating  triers” approach, all potential members of the jury would be in courtroom  during the “challenge for cause” questioning (meaning that they could hear  everyone’s answers).  Another method of choosing jurors was through “static triers”. That’s when  the judge would select two people from the jury panel to determine the  fair-mindedness of every juror. After the full jury was selected, these two  deciders would be sent home. With this process, all potential members of the  jury would be asked to wait outside during the questioning (meaning that they  could not hear everyone’s answers). Mr. Jaser wanted “rotating triers”. He also wanted the trial judge to use  his discretion (power) to remove potential jurors from the courtroom during the  process because hearing other people’s answers might make them biased. If his  request could not be granted, Mr. Jaser wanted “static triers”.  The trial judge refused Mr. Jaser’s request for “rotating triers”. He concluded  that trial judges did not have the power to exclude unsworn jurors from the  courtroom where “rotating triers” were being used. In any event, he said that  he would not have used the discretion even if he had it. He believed that to accept  Mr. Jaser’s request would be to expose the sworn jurors (actual members of  jury) to the possible biased comments of potential jurors, and this could pose  a risk to the trial’s fairness.  In the end, the trial judge imposed “static triers” in accordance with Mr. Jaser’s  alternative request.  All nine judges of the Supreme  Court agreed with the Court of Appeal that the jury was improperly formed. The  trial judge made an error in refusing Mr. Jaser’s requests for two reasons. First,  the trial judge had the discretion to exclude potential jurors from the  courtroom while using “rotating triers”. Second, his refusal to use his discretion  was unreasonable.  As a result of the error, the Supreme  Court said the jury was not properly formed for Mr. Jaser, as it was  incorrectly selected by “static triers” instead of “rotating triers” with  potential jurors removed from the courtroom. The jury was also improperly  formed for Mr. Esseghaier, as he was denied his right to “rotating triers”.  The judges all agreed that a  specific section of the <em>Criminal Code</em> could be used to remedy jury selection errors. They said the requirements of  that section had been met in this case. Although the procedure for selecting  jurors was technically incorrect, it was one of two alternatives to ensure that  an accused person’s right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial jury  was protected. While Mr. Esseghaier and Mr. Jaser did not receive the specific  jury selection process they wanted, the law does not demand procedurally  perfect justice, but fundamentally fair justice.

2021 SCC 7,"<strong>If a party to a contract exercises its discretion  unreasonably, it breaches a duty of good faith, the Supreme Court has ruled.<em>  </em></strong>
   Wastech Services Ltd. (Wastech) was a company that  moved and disposed of waste. The Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage  District (Metro) was responsible for the administration of waste disposal in  the district.  Wastech and Metro had a long-term contract. The  contract was for the removal and transportation of waste by Wastech. The  contract said that Metro could choose to send the waste to any of three  different disposal sites. Wastech would be paid a different rate depending on  which site was chosen. Wastech was paid more if the site was farther away. However,  the contract aimed to pay Wastech a “target operating ratio” of .89, meaning  costs were 89% of revenue, and it did not guarantee a specific operating ratio in  any given year. The contract also gave Metro discretion to send the waste to  the site of its choice.  In 2011, Metro decided to send more waste to a closer  location. This meant that Wastech did not reach the target operating ratio. As  a result, Wastech said Metro violated the contract.  The contract said that any legal disagreement should  go to arbitration. This is the process where a neutral third party decides who  is correct in a disagreement, not a judge or a court. Wastech told the  arbitrator that Metro violated the contract by distributing waste in a way that  made Wastech unable to reach the target operating ratio under the contract.  The  arbitrator said the parties purposely decided not to include a clause in the  contract to deal with a situation where the distribution of waste made it  impossible for Wastech to reach the target operating ratio. In the arbitrator’s  opinion, Metro was allowed to use its discretion in a way that had a negative  financial impact on Wastech. But Metro had a duty to act in good faith when  using this discretion. Metro breached its duty by using its discretion in a way  that prevented Wastech from having any chance of meeting the target operating  ratio. Therefore, Wastech was entitled to compensation.  The courts  allowed Metro to appeal the arbitrator’s decision. The judge set aside the  arbitrator’s award, because the duty applied by the arbitrator contradicted the  contract made by the parties. The Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s decision.  The Court of Appeal said that the arbitrator applied the wrong legal test, and  extended the duty of good faith further than the law allows.   The  Supreme Court upheld the lower courts’ decisions, setting aside the  arbitrator’s award. It said good faith does not allow a contracting party to use  its discretion unreasonably. The Supreme Court considered discretion to be used <em>unreasonably</em> when it is used in a way  that is unconnected to the purposes for which the parties agreed to have discretion  in the first place. In this case, the contract showed the parties agreed to  give Metro discretion, so Metro could operate efficiently and keep costs low. The  contract did not require Metro to use its discretion to ensure Wastech reached its  target operating ratio in any given year. For this reason, the majority found  that Metro exercised its discretion for the right purposes. Therefore, Metro  did not violate the duty to act in good faith.  The Supreme Court also dealt with good faith in a  contract in <em><a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2020/38463-eng.aspx"">C.M. Callow  Inc. v. Zollinger</a></em>, which was heard on the same day."
2021 SCC 6,"<strong>Both a provincial court and a superior court (allowed to decide criminal  cases) have authority to hear and decide on bail applications of a youth  charged under the Criminal Code, the Supreme Court has decided.</strong>
   This case deals  with the legal concept known as “jurisdiction”. Jurisdiction means the  authority of a court to hear and determine cases. Specifically, if a judge of a  superior court (with authority to decide criminal cases) is allowed to  hear and decide a bail application of a youth charged with murder under the <em>Criminal Code</em>. In Canada, the <em>Youth  Criminal Justice Act</em> (<em>YCJA</em>) is the law that governs the youth  justice system. It applies to young people who are at least 12 but under 18  years old, who are alleged to have committed criminal offences. T.J.M. was a young person according to the <em>YCJA</em>. He was charged with second degree  murder and the Crown (prosecution) gave notice of the intention to seek an  adult sentence if T.J.M. was convicted. Either of these facts allow the young  person to choose the type of trial they want under the <em>YCJA</em>. As such, T.J.M. was given the choice of type of trial. He chose  to be tried by a superior court judge alone (without a jury) with a preliminary  inquiry. In Alberta, the superior court is called “Court of Queen’s Bench of  Alberta”.  T.J.M.’s lawyer appeared in superior court to seek bail  under a section of the <em>YCJA </em>which  saysif a young person is charged  with an offence that falls under a specific section of the <em>Criminal Code, </em>only a  youth justice court judge can release the young person from custody. Murder is an offence that falls under that specific section of  the <em>Criminal Code</em>.   The superior court judge found that he did not have  jurisdiction to hear the application for bail of a young person even if their choice  was to be tried in the superior court. He found that only the designated youth  justice court of the province had jurisdiction – in this case, the provincial  court. He based his decision on his interpretation of the <em>YCJA</em>. In Alberta, the provincial court is called “Provincial Court  of Alberta”.  All nine judges of the Supreme Court of Canada agreed that the <em>YCJA</em> defines “youth justice court” as  any court established by the province as a youth justice court and a judge  sitting in that court as a “youth justice judge”. The <em>YCJA</em> also describes three circumstances where the superior court of  criminal jurisdiction in the province would have authority. Those are any of  the circumstances where the youth is given the choice to decide on the type of  trial and the youth chooses to be tried by a superior court judge with or  without a jury.  The Supreme  Court judges said it did not matter what type of trial was chosen. The <em>YCJA</em> requires that the youth be tried by  a youth justice court judge. This means by either a judge of the provincial  youth justice court or a judge of a superior court.  The Supreme Court then looked at the meaning of the word  “proceeding” in this context. They said the word “proceeding” was not limited  to the trial. It includes any steps after a young person chooses to be tried in  the superior court, including an application for bail. Given that, a superior  court judge has jurisdiction to hear and decide an application for bail.  It also  found that both the provincial youth justice and superior courts have the  authority over bail in such circumstances. In this case, the  issue was “moot” before the Supreme Court heard it. This means a judge’s  decision does not matter for the immediate purpose of the parties. The Crown  had already entered a “stay of proceedings”, which means that the criminal  process was stopped. T.J.M. was released from custody and there would be no preliminary  hearing or trial.     This case has a  “publication ban”, which in this case, means no one is allowed to publish <em>anything</em> that could reveal T.J.M.’s identity. Courts  use initials to protect the identities of those people involved in the case.  The punishment for breaking the publication ban could be jail, a fine, or both.  People may publish things about the case, as long as they don’t reveal  identities of people protected by the ban.    As a general  rule, the <em>YCJA</em> protects the privacy  of young people accused or found guilty of a crime by keeping their identity  and other personal information confidential. "
2022 SCC 54,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules the  confessions made by two men who killed their landlord were admissible as  evidence at their trial. </strong>James Andrew Beaver and Brian John  Lambert rented rooms in a Calgary townhouse from their landlord Sutton Bowers. Mr.  Bowers also lived in the home. On October 9, 2016, Mr. Lambert called 9-1-1 to  say that he and Mr. Beaver had arrived home to find Mr. Bowers dead in a puddle  of blood. Mr. Lambert told the operator they did not know how Mr. Bowers died.  Yet, he admitted the three of them had argued all week, including the night  before, when Mr. Bowers had told him and Mr. Beaver to get out of the house. Shortly after arriving at the scene,  police officers detained Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver under legislation that does  not exist. This breached their rights under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. The police then  transported the two accused to the police station for questioning. At the station, homicide detectives  realized the first officers had unlawfully detained the two men. The detectives  tried to make a “fresh start” by advising them of their <em>Charter</em> rights. They then arrested the men for murder. When  questioned separately, Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver initially denied knowing how  Mr. Bowers died. Eventually, they both confessed to killing him during a fight,  mopping up his blood and dragging his body to the bottom of the stairs to make  his death look like an accident. The trial judge held a <em>voir dire</em>, which is a trial within a  trial without the jury present, to determine if the confessions were admissible  into evidence. The accused argued their confessions were involuntary and thus  inadmissible. They also claimed the police lacked reasonable and probable  grounds to arrest them for murder. Finally, they said their confessions must be  excluded because the detectives had failed to make a “fresh start” after their  unlawful detentions. The trial judge admitted their  confessions into evidence. As a result, the accused submitted an agreed  statement of facts where they admitted their roles in the killing and asked the  trial judge to convict them of manslaughter. The trial judge agreed and  sentenced each to four years in prison. Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver appealed  unsuccessfully to Alberta’s Court of Appeal before turning to the Supreme Court  of Canada. Only Mr. Beaver appealed the voluntariness of his confession. Both  Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver claimed their confessions should be excluded. The Supreme Court has dismissed the  appeals.<strong>The confessions are admissible. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Mahmud Jamal agreed with the lower courts that Mr. Beaver’s  confession was voluntary and thus admissible. He also agreed the police had reasonable and  probable grounds to arrest the two men for murder. However, Justice Jamal found  the homicide detectives had made a “fresh start” from the <em>Charter</em> breaches for Mr. Lambert, but not for Mr. Beaver. Mr. Lambert  confessed only after he consulted counsel, after he understood his rights, and  after he appreciated that he had been arrested for murder. Mr. Beaver had not. Thus,  only Mr. Beaver’s confession was obtained in a manner that breached the <em>Charter</em>. Section 24(2) of the <em>Charter </em>says that when a court concludes  evidence was obtained in a manner that breached anyone’s rights or freedoms  guaranteed by the <em>Charter</em>, the  evidence must be excluded if, having regard to all the circumstances, admitting  it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.Justice Jamal concluded that in this  case admitting Mr. Beaver’s confession into evidence would not bring the  administration of justice into disrepute. He therefore confirmed the men’s  convictions for manslaughter."
2022 SCC 51,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that a court in the <abbr title=""United Arab Emirates"">UAE</abbr> can decide the custody of  two resident children who travelled to Ontario with their Canadian mother. </strong>
   The parents were married in 2012 in Pakistan and then moved to Dubai in  the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where the father works. Both are citizens of  Pakistan but the mother is also a Canadian citizen. Their daughter was born in  2016 and their son in 2019. The mother has always been the primary caregiver  and her residency in Dubai has depended on the father. In June 2020, the mother  travelled to Ontario with the children to visit her family. The father agreed  to the trip but he remained in Dubai. A few weeks later, the mother informed  the father that she would not be returning to Dubai with the children. The father started legal proceedings in Ontario for the children to  return to Dubai. He invoked Ontario’s <em>Children’s  Law Reform Act</em> (CLRA), which can apply in cases of international child  abduction by a parent. The mother responded by saying she would not return to  Dubai. She asked the Ontario court to decide the custody of the children,  instead of a court in the <abbr title=""United Arab Emirates"">UAE</abbr>. The mother claimed the children would suffer serious harm if they  returned to Dubai and that staying with her in Ontario was in their best  interests. Before the hearing, the father offered to settle their dispute. He  promised to ensure the mother’s independent residency status in Dubai by buying  her a property in her name. He also agreed to allow the children to reside there  primarily with her. Under the <abbr title=""Children’s Law Reform Act"">CLRA</abbr>, Ontario courts typically do not exercise jurisdiction  on custody issues when children have been wrongfully taken from their home in  another country and end up in the province. However, there are exceptional  circumstances when an Ontario court may act. Under section 23 of the law, a  court can act when children are physically present in Ontario and the court is  convinced they would suffer serious harm if removed from there. In this case, the Ontario court declined jurisdiction. The judge was  not convinced the children would suffer serious harm if they returned to Dubai.  He declared that the mother had wrongfully kept the children in Ontario and that  they should be returned to <abbr title=""United Arab Emirates"">UAE</abbr> with or without her. The judge gave the parties an  opportunity to make further submissions on whether to include the father’s  settlement proposal in his order. The mother made no submissions in this regard  and the settlement offer was not included. The mother appealed the order to  Ontario’s Court of Appeal, where it was dismissed. She then appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  <strong>The “serious harm” threshold required  under the <abbr title=""Children’s Law Reform Act"">CLRA</abbr> was not met. </strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Nicholas Kasirer explained  that as a general rule in Canadian family law, the best interests of children  are measured from the children’s perspective and are the paramount  consideration for all decisions that concern them. While separating young children from their primary caregiver could  certainly cause them psychological harm, it will not always rise to the level  of “serious harm” required under the <abbr title=""Children’s Law Reform Act"">CLRA</abbr><em>. </em>Justice Kasirer said the trial  judge in this case made no reviewable error in deciding that this level was not  met. As a result, the custody of the children should be resolved by a court  in the <abbr title=""United Arab Emirates"">UAE</abbr>.  While the majority judges found  no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s assessment, they said the father  should be bound by his initial settlement offer if the mother decides to return  to Dubai.  In this case, the legal question  focused only on jurisdiction. As Justice Kasirer said, the case was not “a  comprehensive comparison of the child’s life in the two jurisdictions”, nor a “broad-based  best interests test” as is conducted on the merits of a custody application. "
2022 SCC 48,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that a cockpit voice recording can be disclosed at an  aviation accident class action trial. </strong>
   In March 2015, an Air  Canada flight from Toronto had an accident upon landing in wind and snow at  Halifax’s Stanfield International Airport. The flight was carrying 133  passengers and 5 crew members. Several people were injured, including 25 who  were taken to local hospitals. Following the accident, some of the passengers  filed a class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. They claimed that  negligence on the part of the airline, its pilots, the aircraft manufacturer,  the airport and others, caused them harm.  In an exercise  unrelated to the class action, the Transportation and Safety Board of Canada  (the Board) investigated the accident. The Board is a federal government agency  mandated to improve aviation safety. Following its investigation, the Board issued  a report but did not assign blame as that is not its role. The Board is not  part of the class action.   As part of its defence,  the aircraft manufacturer filed a motion asking the court to order the release of  the cockpit voice recording. It records the communications of the flight crew  and is part of the so-called “black box” from the aircraft. The aircraft  manufacturer argued that access to the recording was necessary for a fair trial  and to determine what caused the accident. The only copy of the recording was  with the Board and it opposed its release. So did the airline and its pilots,  who wanted to protect pilot privacy.  The Board claimed the recording  was protected by “statutory privilege”, meaning a specific rule in a law  protected it from being disclosed. In this case, section 28 of the <em>Canadian Transportation Accident  Investigation and Safety Board Act</em> (the Act) states no one can be required  to produce an on-board recording or give evidence related to it in legal  proceedings unless authorized to do so by a court or coroner. Section 28(6) also  states that a judge or coroner must examine the on-board recording “<em>in camera</em>”, meaning not before members  of the public, and give the Board a reasonable opportunity to make observations  about the recording. The privilege attached to an on‑board recording serves  two purposes: to protect pilot privacy and to promote aviation safety.  The motion judge  listened to the recording <em>in camera</em>,  and decided it was reliable, relevant and necessary evidence for resolving the  class action. He said the importance of the recording to the administration of  justice outweighed the importance of the statutory privilege. The judge refused  the Board’s request to present observations or arguments about the recording,  concluding that such arguments were unnecessary for him to understand what was  at stake. The Board appealed the judge’s ruling to Nova Scotia’s Court of  Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and the Board appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.  <strong>The judge made no errors in ordering the  recording’s disclosure, so</strong> <strong>it can be released.</strong>
     Writing for a majority  of the judges, Justice Nicholas Kasirer said the motion judge made no reviewable  errors in deciding to order the disclosure of the recording. As such, the  decision to release the recording stands.  The majority said the  judge or coroner who is presented with a request for disclosure has the option  of ordering the disclosure or not based on the test set out in the Act. That  test is whether the public interest in the proper administration of justice  outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the on-board recording.  “In this balancing  exercise, the decision‑maker must place two competing public interests on the  scales: on one side, the relevance, probative value and necessity of the  on-board recording to the fair resolution of the dispute and, on the other, the  effects of disclosure on pilot privacy and aviation safety”, Justice Kasirer  wrote.  Having weighed the  relevant factors, the majority found the judge made a fact-driven and  discretionary decision. Since there was no error of law or palatable and  overriding error of fact or proof he abused his discretion, the judge’s decision  should stand.   The majority also rejected  the Board’s claims regarding its right to make arguments <em>in camera</em> without the other parties present. They noted that the  judge had the discretion to hear such arguments or not. While <em>in camera</em> necessarily means without the  public, the judge also had the discretion to allow other parties to be present  or not."
2022 SCC 47,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an  online police investigation targeting people searching for sex with children was  not entrapment. </strong>“Project Raphael” was an online investigation conducted by the York Regional  Police in Ontario between 2014 and 2017. It targeted people searching online who  wanted to pay to have sex with girls and boys. It involved police placing fake  advertisements on the escort sub-section of a website called Backpage.com. People  who engaged with these ads were led to text message conversations between a  supposed 18-year-old sex worker, who was actually an undercover police officer.  Once the prospective client and the undercover officer agreed to a sexual  transaction, the officer would then reveal that they were too young for sex  work. Every client who agreed to continue with the transaction and showed up to  the designated hotel room, was arrested. Project Raphael led to the arrest of  104 men, including Temitope Dare.  Mr. Dare was charged with three offences: (1) telecommunicating with a  person he believed was under the age of 18, for the purpose of obtaining sexual  services; (2) telecommunicating with a person he believed was under the age of  16, for the purpose of inviting sexual touching; and (3) communicating to  obtain sexual services for consideration from a person under the age of 18.  A jury convicted Mr. Dare of all three offences but he applied to have the  proceedings against him stopped, alleging that he was the victim of police  entrapment. Mr. Dare argued that officers had offered him the opportunity to  commit a crime. To avoid an operation being considered entrapment, a police  investigation must be a “<em>bona fide</em> inquiry”. In this case, it meant that police must have had reasonable suspicions  that a crime was being committed in the escorts section of the Backpage.com  website. Having considered the entrapment test, the judge found that Mr. Dare  was not entrapped and dismissed his application. Mr. Dare appealed to Ontario’s  Court of Appeal, which dismissed his appeal.

Every client who agreed to continue with the  transaction and showed up to the designated hotel room, was arrested. Project  Raphael led to the arrest of 104 men, including Corey Ramelson.  Mr. Ramelson was charged with three offences: (1) telecommunicating  with a person he believed was under the age of 16, for the purpose of inviting  sexual touching; (2) communicating to obtain sexual services for consideration  from a person under the age of 18; and (3) telecommunicating to make  arrangements to commit sexual offences against a person he believed was under  the age of 16.  A trial was held and Mr. Ramelson was convicted of all three offences  but he applied to have the proceedings against him stopped, alleging that he  was the victim of police entrapment. Mr. Ramelson argued officers had offered  him the opportunity to commit a crime. To avoid an operation being considered  entrapment, a police investigation must be a “<em>bona fide</em> inquiry”. In this case, it meant that police must have had  reasonable suspicions that a crime was being committed in the escorts section  of the Backpage.com website. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice initially dismissed Mr.  Ramelson’s entrapment application in November 2019. However, after the Supreme  Court of Canada’s May 2020 ruling in <em><a href=""../2020/38165-38304-eng.aspx"">R. v.  Ahmad</a></em>, the Ontario court invited the parties to make additional  submissions and ultimately revised its decision, finding that police had  entrapped Mr. Ramelson. The <em>Ahmad</em> decision had reviewed what could be considered a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry in virtual spaces. In light of that judgment, the  Ontario Superior Court concluded that Project Raphael was not a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry because the classified  ads website was too broad a space to support a reasonable suspicion. The Crown  appealed that decision to Ontario’s Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal. Mr.  Ramelson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  Members of the Court heard this case together with <em><a href=""39676-eng.aspx"">R. v. Jaffer</a></em>, <em><a href=""39803-eng.aspx"">R. v. Haniffa</a></em> and <em><a href=""39871-eng.aspx"">R. v. Dare</a></em>,  and the judgments are being rendered at the same time. Those cases also  involved individuals claiming they were entrapped as a result of Project  Raphael, and their appeals have also been dismissed.  <strong>Mr. Ramelson was not entrapped. </strong>
     Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis said Project  Raphael was a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry  because “police had reasonable suspicion in a space defined with sufficient  precision”. The space was the particular type of ads within the York Region  escort subdirectory of Backpage.com that emphasized the sex worker’s youth. She  also said that the offences police provided the opportunity to commit “were  rationally connected and proportionate” to the offences they suspected were  occurring in that space.   To determine whether an investigation, conducted on broad virtual  spaces, such as the Internet, is precisely defined, courts must look at the  space’s function, its interactivity and the sub-spaces embedded into the  broader virtual space.  Justice Karakatsanis  said the entrapment doctrine strives to balance competing interests: the rule  of law and the need to protect an individual’s privacy interests and personal  freedom from state overreach, with the state’s interest in investigating and  prosecuting crime. Requiring police investigations to pass the <em>bona fide</em> inquiry test, helps to ensure  that balance. "
2022 SCC 43,"<strong>The  Supreme Court clarifies how an “accounting of profits” should be calculated for  patent infringement. </strong>
   Nova Chemicals  Corporation (Nova) and Dow Chemical Company (Dow) are competitors in the  plastics industry. Dow patented thin but strong plastics used in products such  as garbage bags and food wrappings. When Nova manufactured and sold products  covered by Dow’s patent, Dow sued for patent infringement.  The Federal Court  found that Nova had violated Dow’s patent. As a remedy, Dow asked the court to  calculate its award based on the profits Nova made by violating the patent.  This is called an “accounting of profits”. To determine the money owed to Dow, the  court calculated the revenues Nova had earned by selling the infringing  plastics. It then deducted what Nova had paid to produce the patented plastics. The main chemical  ingredient in theses patented plastics is called ethylene. Nova produces  ethylene for less than what it would cost to buy this product on the market. Yet,  Nova asked the court to use the market cost of ethylene when calculating how  much to deduct from its revenues, instead of its actual cost. The Federal Court  refused. It deducted the actual cost of Nova’s ethylene production when  calculating the amount it had to pay Dow.  In addition to the  profits Nova earned before the patent expired, Dow argued it should also  receive some of the profits Nova made after the patent’s expiry that resulted  from the infringement.  An advantage of  having a patent is that an inventor has the opportunity to sell their product  on the market before anyone else. A company who violates a competitor’s patent  will take over market shares more quickly after the expiry of a patent. Profits  earned from that advantage are called “springboard” profits.  The Federal Court  agreed. Nova then appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal to reduce the award. It  argued that, if it had not used its ethylene to make the patented plastics, it  would have sold that ethylene to a third party, so it should be able to keep  what it would have made from selling it. The Federal Court of Appeal disagreed  and upheld the original award. Nova then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.  <strong>The lower courts did not make errors in  calculating the award. </strong>
     Writing for a majority  of the judges, Justice Malcolm Rowe said the lower courts calculated Nova’s accounting  of profits correctly. He also said Dow is entitled to the springboard profits. The majority judges  rejected new arguments Nova had raised before the Supreme Court. Nova had said  that it could have used its own ethylene to produce a completely different kind  of plastic used to make pails and crates. It argued that it should be able to  keep what it would have made selling those products.The majority ruled  that the court should only deduct profits made from products that are comparable,  but do not infringe the patent. Since pail and crate plastics are nothing like  the patented plastics, they could not be used as a hypothetical non-infringing  option. “The pail and crate plastics markets and patented plastics markets do  not overlap. A potential buyer interested in the patented plastics would not  purchase pail and crate plastics as an alternative”, Justice Rowe wrote."
2022 SCC 42,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that stock  options donated to charities by an employee are employment income under  Quebec’s <em>Taxation Act</em>. </strong>
  Mr. Yves Des Groseillers worked for a company that granted him stock  options, which he donated to registered charities. During an audit of his tax  returns, the <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">Agence du revenu du Québec</span> (ARQ) added the value of the donated stock  options to his employment income. That meant Mr. Des Groseillers would have to  pay more income tax.  Mr. Des Groseillers appealed <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr""><abbr title=""Agence du revenu du Québec"">ARQ</abbr></span>’s decision to the Court of Québec,  which ruled in his favour. It found he received no benefit for donating his  stock options, so their value should not be added to his employment income. The  ARQ then appealed to Quebec’s Court of Appeal, which sided with the ARQ and  restored the agency’s original decision to add the stock options to Mr. Des  Groseillers’ employment income. Mr. Des Groseillers then appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  <strong><span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr""><abbr title=""Agence du revenu du Québec"">ARQ</abbr></span> was correct to add the value  of the stock options to Mr. Des Groseillers’ employment income.</strong>
     In a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court said the Court of Appeal  correctly applied sections 50 and 422 of Quebec’s <em>Taxation Act</em>. Pursuant to section 50 of the Act, if an employee  transfers stock options received under an employee plan to another person or organization  they have no relation to, they are considered to have received a taxable  employment benefit equal to the monetary value of those options. Under section  422 of the Act, such donations are considered to have been made at the fair  market value of the stock options at the time of the gift.  “Like the Court of Appeal, we conclude that the [<span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr""><abbr title=""Agence du revenu du Québec"">ARQ</abbr></span>] properly assessed  Mr. Des Groseillers for the benefit received”, the Supreme Court said. ARQ was  correct to add the value of the stock options to Mr. Des Groseillers’  employment income. "
2022 SCC 41,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that an arbitration agreement does not trump a lawsuit.</strong>
   Peace River Hydro  Partners is a partnership of several businesses formed to build a hydroelectric  dam in northeastern British Columbia. In 2015, Peace River subcontracted some  work to Petrowest Corporation, an Alberta-based construction company and its  affiliates. The contracts for this work contained agreements that the two  parties would settle any disputes through arbitration. Not long after,  Petrowest found itself in financial difficulty and could not repay its debts.  Under the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>,  an Alberta court appointed the company Ernst &amp; Young as “receiver” for  Petrowest. That meant Ernst &amp; Young were responsible for taking control of  the company with the purpose of helping Petrowest repay its creditors.  The receiver started a  lawsuit against the Peace River partnership in British Columbia, seeking to  collect on money it said was owed to Petrowest and its affiliates for  subcontracted work. Peace River responded by asking the court to stop the  lawsuit. It argued that the dispute should be settled by arbitration, as  outlined in its contract with Petrowest. Section 15(1) of British Columbia’s <em>Arbitration Act</em> states that if one party  to an arbitration agreement starts legal action, the other party can ask the  court to stop the lawsuit. Section 15(2) states that a court must stop the  legal proceedings unless it determines that the arbitration agreement is void,  inoperative or incapable of being performed.  The receiver opposed  Peace River’s attempt to stop the lawsuit. Ernst &amp; Young argued that the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em> permits  the court to exercise central judicial control over the dispute instead of  sending the receiver to multiple arbitration forums. The judge agreed with the  receiver and allowed the lawsuit to proceed. Peace River appealed that decision  to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. When it dismissed the appeal, Peace  River appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. The lawsuit against Peace River can proceed to trial.  <strong>The arbitration agreements are inoperative. </strong>
     The Supreme Court  unanimously dismissed the appeal. Explaining why the majority of judges dismissed  the appeal, Justice Suzanne Côté said the arbitration agreements were inoperative.  She said section 15 of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> does not mean a court  must always stop a lawsuit by a court-appointed receiver when there has been an  agreement to arbitrate. Rather, a court may allow the lawsuit to proceed if the  party trying to avoid arbitration proves the arbitration agreement is “void, inoperative  or incapable of being performed” within the meaning of section 15(2). An  arbitration agreement can be considered inoperative “if enforcing it would  compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership”. This analysis  is highly fact-specific.  In this case, there  were multiple and overlapping arbitration agreements. This would have involved  the receiver participating in and funding at least four different arbitrations  with seven different sets of parties. Paying for these processes would have come  from the assets of Petrowest and its affiliates. This would only hurt the creditors  and run contrary to the objectives of the <em>Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act</em>. The majority found that settling the matter with one  lawsuit would be faster and cheaper, which was in the interest of the  receivership. "
2022 SCC 39,"<strong>The Supreme  Court rules that banning conditional sentences for certain offences is constitutional. </strong>
   In 2015, Cheyenne  Sharma, arrived in Toronto on an international flight with almost two kilograms  of cocaine in her suitcase. The 20-year-old woman with no criminal record  confessed to the RCMP that her partner had promised her $20,000 to bring the  suitcase to Canada. She plead guilty to importing cocaine. Since Ms. Sharma is a  woman of Ojibwa ancestry and member of the Saugeen First Nation, the court requested  a <em>Gladue</em> report, which is a pre-sentencing  report for Indigenous offenders. This report noted that Ms. Sharma’s  grandmother was a residential school survivor and that her mother had spent  time in foster care. The report also noted that Ms. Sharma had been sexually  assaulted and had dropped out of school.  The <em>Gladue </em>report gets its  name from the Supreme Court of  Canada’s 1999 ruling in <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1695/index.do"">R.  v. Gladue</a></em>, which established the factors that courts must take  into account when sentencing Indigenous offenders.  Conditional sentencing  was introduced in 1996. This type of punishment allows offenders to serve their  sentences under strict surveillance in their communities, rather than in jail.  In 2012, Parliament changed the law to eliminate conditional sentences for  certain offences listed in paragraphs 742.1(b) to (f) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  Three requirements  must be met before a conditional sentence can be imposed: (1) the offender must  not have been convicted of any of those offences; (2) a court would have otherwise  imposed a prison sentence of less than two years; and (3) the safety of the  community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the  community. If an offender meets these requirements, a judge must then determine  whether a conditional sentence is appropriate and in line with the fundamental  principles of sentencing. This includes section 718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which directs  judges to consider alternatives to imprisonment “with particular attention to  the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders”. This provision was enacted to reduce  the overrepresentation of Indigenous offenders in jail, among other reasons.  When Ms. Sharma sought  a conditional sentence, she was found ineligible because she had plead guilty  to an offence covered by section 742.1(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> and which carried a maximum prison sentence of 14  years or life. Ms. Sharma challenged the constitutionality of that section,  along with section 742.1(e)(ii), which makes conditional sentences unavailable  for any offence that carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and involves  drugs.  The sentencing judge confirmed  that Ms. Sharma was not eligible for a conditional sentence. He also dismissed  her challenges under sections 7 and 15 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </em>Section 7 guarantees  everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the person, while section  15 guarantees everyone the right to equal treatment before the law. The sentencing  judge imposed an 18-month prison sentence.  Ms. Sharma appealed her  sentence and the dismissal of her <em>Charter </em>challenges to the Ontario Court of Appeal. It allowed her appeal and ruled  that sections 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) had violated section 7 because they  were too broad, and had violated section 15 because they discriminated against  Indigenous offenders like Ms. Sharma. The Court of Appeal sentenced Ms. Sharma  to time already served in jail. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has  allowed the Crown’s appeal.  <strong>Sections 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> are constitutional. </strong>
     Writing for a majority  of the judges, Justices Russell Brown and Malcolm Rowe found sections 742.1(c)  and 742.1(e)(ii) constitutional. They said there is no section 15 <em>Charter </em>violation. The majority noted  that although the crisis of Indigenous incarceration is undeniable,  Ms. Sharma did not demonstrate that the challenged provisions created or  contributed to a disproportionate impact on Indigenous offenders, compared to  non‑Indigenous offenders. Ms. Sharma was required to show this disproportionate  effect as a first step in the section 15 analysis, which she did not.  The majority also said  there is no section 7 <em>Charter </em>violation  because the provisions achieve their intended purpose, which is “to enhance  consistency in the conditional sentencing regime by making imprisonment the  typical punishment for certain serious offences and categories of offences”. They  added that maximum sentences provide a reasonable indication of the seriousness  of an offence, and as such, the provisions do not deprive individuals of their  liberty in circumstances that are unconnected to their objective.  Ms. Sharma’s 18-month prison  sentence was restored. However, since she has already served her time in  prison, no further orders were made. "
2022 SCC 38,"<strong>The Supreme Court finds the mandatory  and lifetime registration on the sex offender registry unconstitutional. </strong>
   This ruling has important implications for the registration of sex  offenders.  The <em>Sex Offender Information Registration  Act (SOIRA)</em> came into force in 2004. It created a national sex offender  registry. To place an offender on the registry, a Crown prosecutor had to apply  for a “<em>SOIRA</em> order”. The judge would  then decide to grant the order or exclude the offender from the registry.  Judges had discretion to determine if the effect of the order on the offender’s  privacy or liberty would exceed the public interest in protecting society.  In 2011, Parliament changed the law. It removed the discretion of the  Crown and the sentencing judge to exclude an offender from the registry. Since  then, section 490.012 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> has required the mandatory registration of anyone found guilty of a sexual  offence. This means the personal information of every sex offender must be  added to Canada’s national registry. Section 490.013(2.1) also imposed a  mandatory registration for life, for those who committed more than one such  offence.  In 2015, Eugene Ndhlovu pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault  against two people at a party four years earlier when he was 19-years-old. The  trial judge sentenced him to six months in jail, to be followed by three years  of probation. After reviewing Mr. Ndhlovu’s history and the evidence, the judge  found he was unlikely to re-offend. However, due to the legislative changes in 2011,  Mr. Ndhlovu was automatically subject to a lifetime registration on the national  sex offender registry. After his sentencing, Mr. Ndhlovu challenged the constitutionality of sections  490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. The judge concluded that those provisions violated section 7 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (the <em>Charter</em>), which guarantees  everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the person.  The Crown then asked the court to decide if the provisions could be acceptable  under section 1 of the <em>Charter</em>. That  section permits courts to find otherwise unconstitutional laws justifiable in a  free and democratic society. The judge concluded that sections 490.012 and  490.013(2.1) could not be saved by section 1. She then declared the provisions  to be without force or effect and did not order Mr. Ndhlovu to register himself.  The Crown appealed that decision to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. It found  the provisions were constitutional. Mr. Ndhlovu then appealed to the Supreme  Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court allows the appeal.  <strong>Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> are  unconstitutional. </strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges, Justices Andromache Karakatsanis  and Sheilah L. Martin said the two provisions of the <em>Criminal Code</em> violate section 7 of the <em>Charter</em> in a way that cannot be justified in a free and democratic  society. These provisions infringe  on the right to liberty protected under section 7 of the <em>Charter,</em> “because registration has a serious impact on the freedom  of movement and of fundamental choices of people who are not at an  increased risk of re‑offending”. Registering offenders who are not at risk of  committing a future sex offence is disconnected from the purpose of  registration, which is to capture information about offenders to help police  prevent and investigate sex offences.  As such, the majority has declared the provisions unconstitutional. They  said the declaration of invalidity for section 490.012 will take effect in one  year. The finding for section 490.013(2.1) takes effect immediately and is  considered invalid from the time it was enacted in 2011.  As for Mr. Ndhlovu, the judges granted him an exemption to section 490.012  pending its declaration of invalidity. This means he does not have to register  in the sex offender registry. "
2022 SCC 37,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds the  eight-year prison sentence for a B.C. man who sexually assaulted two girls. </strong>
   In 2019, Kerry Nahanee plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault  against his nieces. Mr. Nahanee admitted to sexually assaulting one niece once and  sexually assaulting the other niece many times. At the sentencing hearing, the  Crown asked the judge to sentence Mr. Nahanee to between four to six years in  prison. The lawyer for Mr. Nahanee asked the judge for a sentence of three to  three-and-a-half years.  The judge sentenced Mr. Nahanee to five years for the assaults on the  first niece and three years for the assault on the second niece for a combined  total of eight years in prison. The judge considered various aggravating and  mitigating factors in calculating Mr. Nahanee’s sentence. Aggravating factors  increase the severity of a sentence, while mitigating factors contribute to a  more lenient sentence.   In the judge’s view, the aggravating factors in this case included: abuse of a family member; abuse of a  person under the age of 18; abuse of a position of trust; and that the offences  significantly impacted the two victims. As for mitigating factors, Mr. Nahanee  had plead guilty, he was relatively young, and he had no criminal record.  The judge also  considered Mr. Nahanee’s Indigenous background during sentencing. Section  718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> directs  courts to pay special attention to the circumstances of Indigenous offenders. As  such, the judge reviewed the <em>Gladue </em>report, which is a pre-sentencing  report done for Indigenous offenders.The <em>Gladue </em>report gets its name from the Supreme Court of Canada’s 1999 ruling in <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1695/index.do"">R. v.  Gladue</a></em>, which established the factors that courts must take into  account when sentencing Indigenous offenders.   Mr. Nahanee appealed  his sentence to British Columbia’s Court of Appeal. He argued that the “public  interest test” established by the Supreme Court of Canada in its 2016 ruling in<em> <a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16201/index.do"">R.  v. Anthony-Cook</a></em> should apply to his case. That test guides  judges when the Crown prosecutor and defence lawyer agree to a specific  sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. According to the test, judges should  impose the agreed-upon sentence unless it would bring the administration of  justice into disrepute, which is never in the public interest. Mr. Nahanee also  argued the sentencing judge should have advised the parties that she intended  to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown was seeking. The Court of Appeal  dismissed Mr. Nahanee’s appeal. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has  dismissed Mr. Nahanee’s appeal.  <strong>The <em>Anthony-Cook</em> case does not apply. </strong>
     Writing for the  majority, Justice Michael Moldaver said that the public interest test in the <em>Anthony-Cook</em> case, “does not, and should not, apply  to contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea”. The <em>Anthony-Cook</em> case applies only when both  parties propose a joint submission on sentencing, meaning they agree on the  sentence. Mr. Nahanee’s case involved a contested sentencing hearing because  the Crown and defence lawyer had proposed different sentences.  The majority said  judges must notify the parties if they intend to impose a harsher sentence than  the one sought by the Crown. The judge must then give the parties the  opportunity to make further submissions.      In this case, the  judge did not notify the parties that she intended to impose a harsher sentence  and did not provide them an opportunity to make further submissions. However,  the majority said Mr. Nahanee did not show he had information to provide the  judge that would have impacted his sentence. Also, the judge provided adequate  reasons for why she exceeded the sentence the Crown was seeking and her  reasons, when read as a whole, were not wrong. Finally, the eight-year sentence  was not demonstrably unfit.  "
2022 SCC 36,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that a  private Halifax land developer can take the regional municipality to court for  its plan to expropriate its land.</strong>
   The Annapolis Group started buying lands in the Halifax area in the  1950s. Over time, it acquired 965 acres of land, which the company planned to  develop and sell. In 2006, Halifax adopted a 25-year Regional Municipality Planning  Strategy for land development. It included the Annapolis lands. The planning strategy indicates some of those lands would be zoned for  a public park with the rest designated for “serviced development”, such as  residential neighbourhoods. For serviced development to occur, Halifax must  adopt a resolution authorizing a “secondary planning process” and make an  amendment to the land use by-law. Annapolis made several attempts to develop the lands, starting in 2007,  with no success. In 2016, Halifax ultimately adopted a resolution refusing to  initiate the secondary planning process. Annapolis responded by filing a lawsuit against Halifax in the Supreme  Court of Nova Scotia. It claimed, among other things, that Halifax had  essentially expropriated private property for a public park, which amounted to  a “constructive taking”. In 2019, Halifax asked the court for summary judgment  to dismiss the constructive taking claim from the lawsuit. Summary judgment is  a procedure that allows a party in a lawsuit to ask the court to decide an  issue without a full trial. In response, Annapolis argued that its claim of constructive taking  raised issues that required a trial. The judge agreed but Halifax appealed that  decision to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal. Based on the Supreme Court of  Canada’s 2006 ruling in <em>Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City)</em>, the Court  of Appeal concluded that Annapolis had no reasonable chance of success.  Annapolis then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.<em><u> </u></em>
   The Supreme Court has allowed Annapolis’s claim of constructive taking  to proceed to trial.  <strong>The claim raises disputed issues  of fact that need to be decided at trial. </strong>
   Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justices Suzanne  Côté and Russell Brown found that Annapolis’ claim of constructive taking  raises disputed issues of fact that must be decided at trial, based on the  constructive taking test set out in the <em>Canadian  Pacific Railway Co.</em> case.  There are two parts to the test for establishing a constructive taking.  First, the test must show the government has acquired a beneficial interest in  the property or flowing from the property. A beneficial interest is an  advantage, such as when private property is enjoyed as a public resource. Second,  the test requires showing the proposed regulatory measures would remove all  reasonable uses of the private property.  The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal had  interpreted the first part of the test as requiring Annapolis to show that  Halifax had actually taken possession of the lands. However, Justices Côté and  Brown wrote, “what must be shown by the property owner can fall short of an  actual acquisition by the state.” The majority said the Court of Appeal was also  wrong in holding that Halifax’s intention is irrelevant to applying the second  part of the test. The majority of the Supreme Court  noted, “Annapolis is entitled to adduce evidence at trial to show that, by  holding Annapolis’ land out as a public park, Halifax has acquired a beneficial  interest therein; and that, because Halifax is unlikely to ever lift zoning  restrictions constraining the development of Annapolis’ land, Annapolis has  lost all reasonable uses of its property”. Annapolis may also adduce evidence  of Halifax’s intention in not doing so, the majority said."
2022 SCC 35,"<strong>The Supreme Court restores an Alberta man’s murder  conviction after finding his statements to police were admissible as evidence  at trial. </strong>
   In 2007, police in Alberta questioned Russell Tessier in connection with  the murder of his friend, whose body had been found in a ditch by a rural road  near the town of Carstairs. Officers interviewed Mr. Tessier twice at the  police station without placing him under arrest. They did not advise him that he  could choose not to speak to police and that what he said could be used as  evidence in court (this is known as a caution). In 2015, police charged Mr.  Tessier with first degree murder after his DNA was matched to a cigarette butt  found near the crime scene.  At trial, the Crown tried to introduce evidence from the 2007 police  interview with Mr. Tessier. Under the confessions rule, statements with police are  generally considered voluntary – and therefore admissible as evidence – if the  person had a functioning mind at the time and made the statements without being  threatened or tricked by police.  Mr. Tessier claimed his statements were involuntary. He alleged that he  had been psychologically detained by police, which triggered rights that apply  to people who are detained or arrested. For instance, section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> provides  that “everyone has the right on arrest or detention to retain and instruct  counsel without delay and to be informed of that right”.  The trial judge determined that Mr. Tessier had a functioning mind and  made the statements without being threatened or tricked by police. The judge  also determined that Mr. Tessier had not been detained when he spoke with  police. As a result, the statements were voluntary and admissible as evidence  at trial. The jury eventually convicted Mr. Tessier of first degree  murder. Mr. Tessier appealed his conviction to Alberta’s Court of Appeal,  arguing that his statements to police should not have been admitted at trial.  The Court of Appeal found errors in the trial judge’s analysis about whether  the statements were voluntary and it ordered a new trial. The Crown then  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the Crown’s appeal and restored Mr. Tessier’s  conviction for first degree murder.   <strong>The statements were voluntary. </strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Nicholas Kasirer found that  despite the absence of a caution, Mr. Tessier’s 2007 statements to police  were voluntary under the confessions rule and therefore admissible as evidence  at trial. The majority wrote that Mr. Tessier had an operating mind at the  time of his interviews, had exercised “a free or meaningful choice” to speak  with police and “was not unfairly denied his right to silence”. Given that  there was a reasonable basis to consider Mr. Tessier a suspect at the time  of questioning, the absence of a caution could mean his statements were involuntary.  However, the Crown discharged its burden by proving that the absence of a  caution was without consequence and that the statements were, beyond a  reasonable doubt and in view of the context as a whole, voluntary. The majority  also rejected Mr. Tessier’s arguments that he had been psychologically detained,  which means the <em>Charter</em> rights that  apply to people detained or under arrest were not applicable. "
2022 SCC 34,"<strong>The Supreme Court restores a British  Columbia man’s murder conviction after confirming the admissibility of an  overheard conversation as evidence at his trial. </strong>
  In September 2016, the body of  Japanese student Natsumi Kogawa was found in a suitcase in Vancouver’s West End.  Police later arrested and charged William Schneider with second degree murder  following a tip from his brother.  A jury trial was held and Mr. Schneider’s  brother testified for the Crown. The brother said he confronted Mr. Schneider after  seeing a photo of him with the missing woman in a news release. He said Mr.  Schneider allegedly admitted that he had been in a relationship with Ms.  Kogawa. The next day, the brother said, Mr. Schneider had attempted suicide in  his presence and told him where to find the woman’s body. The brother testified  that he then overheard Mr. Schneider call his wife on the phone and ask if she  had heard about the missing woman. According to the brother, Mr. Schneider then  told his wife something along the lines of “I did it” or “I killed her”. In his  testimony, the brother said he did not remember “word-for-word” what Mr.  Schneider said, but that he was taking responsibility for the woman’s death.  The judge held a <em>voir dire</em>, which is a trial within a  trial without the jury present, to determine if the brother’s testimony about  what he overheard was admissible as evidence in court. Witness testimony about a  conversation they were not part of is called hearsay evidence. Typically, it is  not admissible as evidence. However, there are certain exceptions.  The judge decided to admit the  evidence about the overheard conversation. She said the words the brother heard  were relevant to an issue at trial. Secondly, the judge determined that the  value of the evidence in proving a point at trial (probative value) outweighed  its potential to be unfair to the accused (prejudicial effect). The jury  convicted Mr. Schneider of second degree murder.  Mr. Schneider appealed his conviction  to British Columbia’s Court of Appeal. He argued the trial judge made a mistake  by admitting his brother’s testimony about the overheard conversation. Two of  the three judges of the Court of Appeal agreed with Mr. Schneider and ordered a  new trial. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has allowed the  Crown’s appeal and restored Mr. Schneider’s conviction for second degree  murder.  <strong>The trial judge did not make an error in deciding to admit the brother’s  testimony. </strong>Writing  for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Malcolm Rowe said  “the trial judge did not err in admitting the brother’s testimony as to what he  overheard the accused say”. Three questions needed to be answered to come to  this conclusion. 
     Was what  the brother overheard relevant? Was an exception to the hearsay rule  applicable? Did the trial judge exercise her discretion correctly in deciding  that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect? The  majority said the answer to all three questions is, “yes’. What the brother  overheard was indeed relevant. Also, the “party admission” exception is  applicable in this case because it allows witness testimony about a confession  even if the witness was not a party to that conversation. Finally, the trial  judge used her discretion correctly and further minimized the potential harmful  effects of the evidence with a strong caution to the jury about what they could  make of it. "
2022 SCC 33,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that when  someone is required by their partner to wear a condom during sex but they do  not, they could be guilty of sexual assault.</strong>
  In March  2017, Ross Kirkpatrick and a woman met online and then in person in British  Columbia. The woman agreed to have sex with Mr. Kirkpatrick, but only if he  wore a condom. They had sexual intercourse twice one night. Mr. Kirkpatrick  wore a condom the first time. The second time, Mr. Kirkpatrick did not wear a  condom, which she only realized after intercourse ended. Based on these events,  Mr. Kirkpatrick was charged with sexual assault. Section 273.1(1) of the <em>Criminal  Code </em>defines consent as a person’s voluntary agreement to “engage in the  sexual activity in question”. At trial, the complainant testified that she had  not consented to the sexual activity in question — in this case, intercourse  without a condom. When the Crown finished presenting its case, Mr. Kirkpatrick  asked the judge to dismiss the charge against him due to lack of evidence. He  claimed the Crown did not prove the absence of consent, because the complainant  consented to the sexual intercourse, regardless of condom use.  Specifically, Mr. Kirkpatrick said the judge should apply the Supreme  Court’s 2014 ruling in <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13511/index.do"">R.  v. Hutchinson</a></em>, which established a test for analyzing consent.  That case also involved a complainant who said she consented to having sex but only  if the accused wore a condom. The accused pierced holes in the condom without  the complainant knowing. The Supreme Court decided that the complainant consented  to the “sexual activity in question” in that case because she agreed to sexual intercourse.  However, the Supreme Court found that the accused obtained the complainant’s consent  by fraud, contrary to section 265(3)(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, since the accused had tampered with the condom. In  the present case, Mr. Kirkpatrick said the complainant agreed to have sexual  intercourse, like in <em>Hutchinson</em>, but  he said there was no evidence of fraud, unlike in <em>Hutchinson</em>.   The judge dismissed the sexual assault charge against Mr. Kirkpatrick due  to lack of evidence. The judge applied <em>Hutchinson</em> and found that because the complainant agreed to have sex with Mr. Kirkpatrick,  she consented to “the sexual activity in question” under section 273.1(1),  although no condom was worn. And, the judge also determined that there was no  evidence that Mr. Kirkpatrick’s failure to wear a condom was fraud under  section 265(3)(c). The  Crown then appealed to British Columbia’s Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal  ordered a new trial, finding that the first judge should not have dismissed the  sexual assault charge based on a lack of evidence. Mr. Kirkpatrick then appealed  to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed Mr. Kirkpatrick’s appeal and has confirmed  a new trial is needed.  <strong>When condom use is a condition  for sexual intercourse, it becomes part of the sexual activity to which the  person consented. </strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice  Sheilah L. Martin said that when condom use is a condition for sexual  intercourse, “there is no agreement to the physical act of intercourse without  a condom”. The condom is part of the “sexual activity in question” to which a  person consented under section 273.1(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. “Since only yes means yes and no means no, it cannot  be that ‘no, not without a condom’ means ‘yes, without a condom’”, Justice  Martin wrote. There is therefore no need to decide whether  the failure to wear a condom in this particular case was fraud. And <em>Hutchinson</em> does not apply to the present  case, but it still applies in cases involving condom sabotage and fraud.  <strong>There  was evidence of the complainant’s lack of consent to sex without a condom. </strong>
     The  complainant provided evidence that she would not have had sex with Mr.  Kirkpatrick without a condom. Accordingly, there was some evidence the  complainant did not consent to the sexual activity in question. The trial judge  made an error in concluding there was no evidence and in dismissing the sexual assault  charge. A new trial is therefore required. "
2022 SCC 32,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms an Alberta  man’s murder confession should not be used at trial because he did not have  enough opportunity to get legal advice.</strong>
   In 2015, police suspected Nigel Lafrance of having been involved in a  murder, and got a search warrant for his home in Fort McMurray, Alberta. On the  morning of March 19, a team of armed police officers entered his home to search  it. They asked Mr. Lafrance if he was willing to answer some questions and,  when he agreed, they drove him to a police station and interviewed him for over  three hours. Police took a blood sample, fingerprints, and Mr. Lafrance’s cell  phones and some clothing. He was not told he could contact a lawyer. On April 7, the police arrested Mr. Lafrance for the murder. This time  the police told him he could contact a lawyer, and Mr. Lafrance had a short  phone call with Legal Aid, who told him he should “get a lawyer” to talk about  his situation. The police then interviewed Mr. Lafrance for several hours. Mr.  Lafrance asked if he could call his father, to help him get a lawyer. The  police refused his request, since he had already called Legal Aid, and the  police pushed for more answers. Mr. Lafrance eventually confessed to the murder. Before the trial, Mr. Lafrance argued that his confession and some  other evidence taken during the date of his first encounter with police should  not be used at his trial. He said he should have been allowed to talk to a  lawyer on March 19 and he should have been given a second chance at contacting  a lawyer during the April 7 interview. Section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> guarantees that “everyone has the right on arrest or detention to retain and  instruct counsel without delay and be informed of that right”. The trial judge refused Mr. Lafrance’s request, and the evidence was  used at his trial. The judge found that because the police had not actually  “detained” Mr. Lafrance during the March 19 interview, they did not need to let  him contact a lawyer on that day. Also, the police was not required to give him  a second chance at talking to a lawyer during the April 7 interview. A jury  convicted Mr. Lafrance of murder. Mr. Lafrance appealed the conviction to Alberta’s Court of Appeal. A  majority of judges in that court sided with Mr. Lafrance. They ordered a new  trial to be held without the confession and without some of the other evidence  the police had obtained. The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has agreed with the Court of Appeal: Mr. Lafrance is  entitled to a new trial. <strong>Mr. Lafrance’s section 10(b) <em>Charter</em> right to counsel was violated.</strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice  Russell Brown found that the police violated Mr. Lafrance’s right to counsel on  both dates. Given the “power imbalance” between police and a person detained by  police, and because legal advice helps “cure” that imbalance, “these were  serious breaches”, he wrote. Whether police actually “detained” someone depends on three questions.  First, how did the person perceive or understand the encounter with the police  — did the person feel forced to comply with police instructions? Second, what  did the police actually do, and how and where did they do it? Third, how would another  person of a similar age, size, racial background and level of experience or  sophistication have felt during the encounter? In this case, the Supreme Court found that the police did in fact  detain Mr. Lafrance after searching his home on March 19. Any reasonable person  in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes would have understood that they were being singled out  for investigation. Several factors support this conclusion: the police’s show  of force in entering the home, waking Mr. Lafrance up and ordering him to  leave; a long ride with police officers to the station; and a lengthy police interview  in a secure area. As well, Mr. Lafrance was 19 years old, is Indigenous, had a  lack of experience with police, and was unfamiliar with his legal rights. He  would not have felt free to remain silent or free to leave. The right to counsel guaranteed by the <em>Charter</em> includes not only informing a detained person of their  right to talk to a lawyer, but also giving them time and an opportunity to  actually get legal advice. A single consultation with a lawyer is usually  enough. However, sometimes the police must provide the detained person with another  chance to talk to a lawyer, especially if the person did not understand their  rights or the advice they received. In this case, the police violated Mr. Lafrance’s right to counsel on  March 19 because they actually detained him but did not tell him he could talk  to a lawyer. The police again violated his right to counsel on April 7. After  his first call to Legal Aid, it was clear Mr. Lafrance did not understand his  rights. The police should have given him another chance at talking to a lawyer  to get legal advice. <strong>Relying on the evidence would damage  the reputation of the justice system.</strong>
     The police only obtained the confession and some other evidence after Mr.  Lafrance’s <em>Charter</em> rights were violated.  The Supreme Court concluded that the confession and the other evidence should not  be used at his trial. The seriousness of the <em>Charter</em> violations committed by the police, and the impact on Mr.  Lafrance’s rights, outweigh the public’s interest in allowing the jury to hear  that evidence. In these circumstances, Justice Brown concluded that allowing this  evidence to be used at trial “would bring the administration of justice into  disrepute”."
2022 SCC 31,"<strong>The Supreme Court finds an accused person  guilty of first degree murder for chasing and then killing a man who escaped  from a moving truck. </strong>
   In 2015, Darren Sundman and two accomplices killed a rival drug dealer.  It happened as all four men were riding in a truck outside Prince George,  British Columbia. Mr. Sundman started hitting the victim with a handgun while  the truck was traveling so fast that the victim could not escape the truck. But  when the truck slowed down to make a turn, the victim jumped out and tried to run  away. Mr. Sundman and the two accomplices chased after the victim on foot. Mr.  Sundman shot the victim several times, stopping him from being able to run any farther.  One of the accomplices then said “I got him, boss”, before shooting the victim  at close range, killing him almost instantly. Even though Mr. Sundman did not  fire the fatal shot, he and the two accomplices had an intent to kill the  victim, and so they were each charged with first degree murder.  First degree murder usually means the murder was both planned and  deliberate. That is, the accused person intended to kill someone and prepared  it or thought it out ahead of time. But an unplanned murder can also be in the  first degree when the accused person killed the victim while committing another  serious offence, such as sexual assault or kidnapping. In this case, the Crown argued  that the murder was planned and deliberate, or that Mr. Sundman and his  accomplices had forcibly confined the victim when they killed him. Forcible  confinement is when someone unlawfully keeps another person trapped or detained  against their will.  At trial, the judge acquitted Mr. Sundman of first degree murder, but  convicted him of second degree murder. The judge found that because the killing  was not planned, and because the victim managed to escape his confinement when  he jumped out of the truck, this could not be first degree murder.  The Crown appealed the verdict to British Columbia’s Court of Appeal. It  overturned the trial judge’s decision and convicted Mr. Sundman of first degree  murder. It said the victim could still be considered “confined” after jumping  out of the truck because he was being chased. Mr. Sundman appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has upheld Mr. Sundman’s conviction for first degree  murder. <strong>Confinement does not always mean  being physically restrained.</strong>  Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice Mahmud Jamal said that, “as  a matter of law and common sense”, the victim’s “brief escape” from the truck does  not change the seriousness of Mr. Sundman’s crime. “On any sensible view,” he  wrote, Mr. Sundman’s “moral blameworthiness cannot be considered to be lower”  simply because the victim “managed to jump from a moving truck and was running  for his life when he was executed just moments later”. Forcible or unlawful confinement involves depriving a person of their  liberty so that they cannot move about the way they want to. The Supreme Court has  clarified that confinement does not mean a person has to be restricted to a  particular place. The person also does not need to be physically restrained.  Restraint can be enforced through violence, fear, intimidation, or through  psychological means or other methods.  In this case, the victim was forcibly or unlawfully confined inside the  truck, because it was moving so fast. When the victim escaped from the truck  and ran, he was still forcibly or unlawfully confined even though he was no  longer physically restrained. He could not move about the way he wanted to,  because Mr. Sundman and his accomplices chased him on foot while shooting at  him with their guns. The Supreme Court concluded that the murder happened while  the victim was still unlawfully confined, even when outside the truck. <strong>The confinement and the murder  did not have to happen at the exact same time.</strong>
     The Supreme Court also said if a murder occurs during another serious  offence, like confinement, treating it as first degree murder does not mean  that the confinement and the killing needed to happen exactly at the same time.  The test is whether the confinement and the murder were part of the same  transaction or interaction, or if they represented a single continuous sequence  of events. In this case, the Supreme Court found that Mr. Sundman and his  accomplices murdered the victim “while committing” the offence of unlawful  confinement, because the two crimes happened in a single transaction between  the victim and his killers. The confinement and the murder were close in time, and  they involved a situation of continuous or ongoing domination over the victim  that began in the truck, continued when the victim briefly escaped, and ended when  he was killed.  As for the accomplices, one was convicted of second degree murder and  the other was convicted of manslaughter. Those verdicts were not appealed to  the Supreme Court."
2022 SCC 30,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules the <em>Copyright  Act </em>only requires users to pay one royalty fee to stream works online. </strong>
   Copyright law protects original works of writing, music or art. Under Canada’s <em>Copyright Act</em>,the person who creates a work holds its “copyright” and is the only  person with the right to reproduce or perform the work. If someone else wants to reproduce or perform the  work, they must ask the copyright holder for permission, and they are usually asked  to pay a fee called a royalty. The copyright holder is also the only person with the right to communicate  the work to the public by telecommunication, such as playing a song on the  radio. In 2012, a new section was added to the <em>Copyright Act </em>to clarify that this right includes “making the work  available” online by uploading it to the Internet. For example, downloading a  song creates a new copy of the music, so a reproduction royalty must be paid. Likewise,  streaming a video of the song is a new performance of the music, so a performance  royalty must be paid.  The Copyright Board of Canada is a federal administrative body whose  mandate includes approving the amount of royalties to be paid for some online  services. It received submissions from different groups on how to interpret the  new section of the <em>Copyright Act</em>,  including the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada  (“SOCAN”). SOCAN is an organization that collects and distributes royalties for  music creators, publishers and visual artists. SOCAN argued that “making works  available” online attracts a royalty separate from the royalties for downloading  or streaming the same works later on. This would mean that, for example, online  music services would have to pay a royalty when they post a song on the  Internet in a way that allows for online access by individual users. Another  royalty would be paid when a song is downloaded or streamed. The Copyright  Board agreed with SOCAN. The Federal Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the Copyright  Board. It said the new section of the <em>Copyright  Act</em> does not create a new and separate royalty for uploading a work, in  addition to the royalty that must be paid when users download or stream the  content. SOCAN appealed the Court of Appeal’s decision. The Supreme Court has dismissed SOCAN’s appeal. <strong>The Copyright Board’s decision  was wrong.</strong>
     Writing for the majority of Supreme Court judges, Justice Malcolm Rowe  found that the Copyright Board’s interpretation of the new section of the <em>Copyright Act</em> was inconsistent with the  text and purpose of the law and how it operates, and ran contrary to previous  decisions of the Supreme Court in other copyright cases. In rejecting the  Board’s and SOCAN’s interpretation, Justice Rowe said “the <em>Copyright Act</em> does not exist solely for the benefit of authors”. The Copyright Board’s interpretation would also force users to pay more  fees if they access works on the Internet instead of using other means, such as  listening to the radio. Justice Rowe said this violates the principle of  technological neutrality: the law should treat online works the same way it  treats offline works. “What matters is what the user receives, not how the user  receives it,” he wrote. For streaming, the Supreme Court found that the new section of the <em>Copyright Act</em> simply clarifies that a  work is “communicated” when it is made available or uploaded online. This  already attracts a royalty. If and when individual users stream that same work,  no additional royalties must be paid. Streaming is part of “one continuous act”  that began when the work was made available online. Because of this, streaming something  that was already uploaded online requires paying only one royalty, not two. Downloading is different. It involves a separate right: the right to  reproduce the work, not the right to communicate the work to the public by telecommunication. This interpretation of the new section of the <em>Copyright Act</em> ensures that Canada complies with its obligations  under an international copyright treaty. The test to determine how courts should review administrative decisions  on legal issues, like the decision of the Copyright Board here, was set out in  an earlier Supreme Court case: <em><a href=""../2019/37748-eng.aspx"">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em>. <em>Vavilov</em> established categories of legal  issues that should be reviewed under the standard of “correctness”.  “Correctness” means that the administrative decision on that issue has to be  the only right answer in light of the law and the facts. But the legal issue  raised by the Copyright Board’s decision in this case did not fall into one of  the existing “correctness” categories. However, <em>Vavilov</em> said that new categories could be created in rare  circumstances. The Supreme Court created a new category of “correctness” review  and found that the Copyright Board’s decision was wrong in this case."
2022 SCC 29,"<strong>The Supreme Court finds no abuse of  process during lengthy disciplinary proceedings against a Saskatchewan lawyer.</strong>Mr. Peter V. Abrametz is a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan  and has practiced law in Prince Albert for 49 years. In 2012, the law society audited  Mr. Abrametz’s financial records, found irregularities and began disciplinary  proceedings against him. Those irregularities included making high-interest  loans to vulnerable clients and issuing cheques to a fictitious person before  endorsing and cashing them. In 2013, the law society notified Mr. Abrametz that he would be  suspended temporarily. However, Mr. Abrametz was allowed to continue practicing,  subject to certain conditions. They included that Mr. Abrametz had to retain a lawyer  to supervise his practice and its financial accounts, including withdrawals. He  was also barred from accepting, endorsing and cashing cheques. The law society served  Mr. Abrametz a second notice in 2014, but again he was allowed to continue to  practice under similar conditions. A year later, the Law  Society issued a formal complaint against Mr. Abrametz and appointed a Hearing  Committee. It wasn’t until 2018 that the law society found him guilty  of four charges of conduct unbecoming a lawyer. It disbarred him with no chance  at applying to rejoin the law society for almost two years. During the disciplinary proceedings, Mr. Abrametz argued that the law society  took too long to investigate and decide his case. He said it amounted to an  abuse of process. The law society’s Hearing Committee dismissed that argument but the Court  of Appeal for Saskatchewan agreed with Mr. Abrametz. The law society then appealed  to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has agreed with the Law Society. <strong>There was no abuse of process.</strong>
     Writing for the majority of Supreme Court judges, Justice Malcolm Rowe  said there is no basis to set aside the Hearing Committee’s finding that there  was no abuse of process. “The Court of Appeal departed from its proper role  when it substituted its own findings of fact.”
     The test to determine whether delays amount to an abuse of process was  set out in an earlier Supreme Court case. It has three steps. First, the delay  must be unreasonable. This is determined by the context, including the nature  and purpose of the proceedings, the length and causes of the delay and the  complexity of the facts and issues in the case. Second, the delay must have  caused the person harm. Examples include psychological or reputational harm,  disruption to family life and loss of work. When these two requirements are  met, courts must conduct a final test to determine if there was an abuse of  process. This test is met when the delay is manifestly unfair to a party or in  some other way brings the administration of justice into disrepute. In this case, Mr. Abrametz has not shown that the Hearing Committee was  wrong in concluding that the delay was long but that it was not inordinate and that  there was no significant prejudice to Mr. Abrametz. Therefore, the test was not  met and the Court of Appeal should not have set aside the Hearing Committee’s  conclusions."
2022 SCC 28,"<strong>The  Supreme Court finds constitutional a new procedure in the<em> Criminal Code</em> for  deciding if a complainant’s private documents can be used by an accused in a  sexual offence trial. </strong>J.J. was accused of sexual assault  in British Columbia. His identity is protected by a publication ban. Shane  Reddick was also accused of the same in Ontario. In both cases, the men argued that  sections 278.92 to 278.94 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> are unconstitutional. Those provisions set out how a judge decides if a  complainant’s private documents (called “records” in the <em>Criminal Code</em>) can be used by the accused during their trial for a  sexual offence. This is known as the record screening process. These provisions  are also used to decide how evidence of the complainant’s past sexual activity  can be used. Evidence like private documents and past sexual activity can be allowed  in certain circumstances.     J.J. had records of communications  between himself and the complainant. He wanted to use those records to  cross-examine the complainant. Likewise, Mr. Reddick wanted to cross-examine  the complainant in his case, but on evidence of her past sexual activity.     Before their trial, both J.J. and  Mr. Reddick asked a judge to decide that the record screening process violated  three of their rights under the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms</em>:the right  to remain silent and to not self-incriminate, the right to a fair trial, and  the right of an accused to present evidence in their defence and challenge the  evidence against them. In J.J.’s  case, the judge found one aspect of the record screening process  unconstitutional. Both the Crown and J.J. appealed the judge’s decision to the  Supreme Court of Canada. A jury later found J.J. not guilty, and the Crown has  not appealed the acquittal.     In Mr.  Reddick’s case, the judge found the entire record screening process  unconstitutional. The complainant asked the Supreme Court for permission to  appeal that decision. She said it affected the right of sexual assault  complainants to participate in decision-making about how details of their  private sexual lives would be used in a public courtroom. The Supreme Court gave  her permission. The Supreme  Court has found the record screening process in sections 278.92 to 278.94 of  the <em>Criminal Code</em> constitutional.<strong>The record screening process does not  violate the <em>Charter</em> rights of the  accused. </strong>
     Writing for a  majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Richard Wagner and  Justice Michael Moldaver said the accused’s rights are not violated. The  accused’s right to silence is not in issue because they are not forced to  testify during the record screening process. Also, the accused’s right to a  fair trial does not mean they can receive the most advantageous or beneficial  trial possible. Finally, the accused’s right to present and challenge evidence  is not unlimited. Ambushing complainants with their own highly private records  at trial can be unfair to complainants and may be contrary to the search for  truth.     The majority explained  that sections 278.92 to 278.94 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> were created to remove barriers preventing sexual assault victims from  coming forward. The goal of those sections was to have a process to protect the  interests of complainants in their own private documents when an accused has those  documents and wants to use them at trial. This process balances the rights and  interests of the accused, the complainant and the public, the majority said."
2022 SCC 27,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that the  Council of Canadians with Disabilities can challenge British Columbia’s mental  health laws. </strong>
   In this case, the Supreme Court was asked to decide if the Council of  Canadians with Disabilities (Council) qualifies for public interest standing in  a lawsuit. Public interest standing allows individuals or organizations to  bring a legal issue to court that is in the public interest even when they are  not directly affected. This happens most often in cases concerning the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  where issues may broadly affect society as a whole. The Council is a not-for-profit  organization working for the rights of people living with disabilities in  Canada. In 2016, the Council and two individuals challenged the constitutionality  of British Columbia’s mental health legislation. The law allows doctors to  administer psychiatric treatment to patients with mental disabilities without  their consent or the consent of someone else on their behalf. According to the Council  and the two people who experienced such treatment without their consent, the  law violates sections 7 and 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>.  Section 7 guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the  person. Section 15(1) says everyone has the right to be treated equally without  discrimination, including on the basis of mental or physical disability.  In 2017, the two individuals withdrew from the lawsuit, which left the Council  to continue the case on its own. The Council sought public interest standing from  British Columbia’s Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Canada had already  established a test to qualify for public interest standing in a previous case. It  consists of three requirements: (1) the case must raise a serious issue the  court can decide; (2) the party raising the issue must have a genuine interest  in the matter; (3) the lawsuit must be a reasonable and effective way to bring  the issue to court.  In this case, the trial judge said the Council failed to meet this test  because the two individuals and the facts of their experiences were no longer  part of the lawsuit. The Council appealed to British Columbia’s Court of  Appeal, which said the judge was mistaken in finding the case had no factual  context.  The Supreme Court says the Council has public interest standing and can continue  the lawsuit.  <strong>The Council meets the test for public  interest standing. </strong>
     Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Chief Justice Richard Wagner said the  Council meets the three-part test for public interest standing. Firstly, it  raises an important issue: the <em>Charter </em>rights  of people with mental disabilities. Secondly, the Council has a genuine  interest in the challenges faced by people with mental disabilities. Thirdly,  its claim is a reasonable and effective way to bring the matter before the  courts. The Chief Justice said a court’s decision to grant or deny public  interest standing is discretionary. Each factor in the three-part test must be  duly considered and no factor takes priority over the others.    The Chief Justice said this case does not turn on individual facts and the  Council could establish a sufficient factual context at trial. “A strict  requirement for a directly affected co-plaintiff would pose obstacles to access  to justice”, the Chief Justice wrote. The Council raises important issues with  the potential of affecting many people with mental health disabilities. The granting  of public interest standing in this case “will promote access to justice for a  disadvantaged group who has historically faced serious barriers to bringing such  litigation before the courts”, the Chief Justice wrote.  "
2022 SCC 26,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that  companies cannot undo transactions that later cause them unintended taxes.</strong>
   This is a case involving two  companies, Rite-Way Metals Ltd. and Harvard Industries Ltd., which were wanting  to avoid paying taxes on some of their assets. The companies followed  guidelines published by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). According to these  guidelines, section 75(2) of the <em>Income  Tax Act</em> allowed companies to avoid taxes on dividends if paid to a family trust.  A dividend is a part of the profit a company pays to its shareholders. A family  trust is a legal entity created to hold assets. Once assets are transferred  into the trust, they are no longer the property of the person who transferred  them. Instead, they belong to the trust, which is then administered for the  benefit of the trustees (or beneficiaries), who are usually members of the  relevant family. In this case, the trusts were for the Collins and Cochran  families. The trusts were created in 2008. A few years later, in an  unrelated case, the Tax Court of Canada issued a decision with a different  interpretation of section 75(2). The effect of the ruling was that family trusts  owe taxes on any such dividends.  The Collins and Cochran family trusts  applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to cancel the transactions  that led to the dividends. British Columbia’s Supreme Court agreed to do so.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the Attorney General of Canada on  behalf of the CRA. The Attorney General then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has agreed with  CRA’s interpretation of the law. <strong>The transactions cannot be cancelled.</strong>
     Writing for the majority of Supreme  Court judges, Justice Russell  Brown said principles of equity and tax law prevent the companies from  reversing their transactions. “Taxpayers should be taxed based on what they  actually agreed to do and did, and not on what they could have done or later  wished they had done,” Justice Brown wrote. A court may grant relief to parties  only when it would be unfair to enforce transactions. The judges wrote there is  nothing unfair about the ordinary application of tax laws to transactions  freely undertaken. If any changes are required, it would be up to Parliament to  make them, not the courts, the majority noted.  <strong>Retroactive tax planning is not allowed. </strong>
     The Supreme  Court has previously stated that retroactive tax planning is not allowed. This  means people cannot later change their tax arrangements to prevent any  unintended negative consequences. Although taxpayers can arrange their finances  as they see fit to reduce their taxes, their planning may have the opposite  effect. If so, they must bear that responsibility. "
2022 SCC 25,"<strong>The Supreme Court restores a foster  parent’s convictions for the death of a child and for causing bodily harm to  another.</strong>
   Kevin Goforth and his wife were charged with the second degree murder  of a four-year old and unlawfully causing bodily harm to a two-year old. Both  children were being foster parented by the Goforths. The parents were accused  of failing to provide the children with the necessaries of life, such as food  and water, contrary to section 215 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.  In 2016, a jury convicted both foster parents of unlawfully causing bodily  harm to the younger child. As to the older child, the jury found the wife  guilty of second degree murder, whereas it found Mr. Goforth guilty of  manslaughter. Second degree murder is a more serious offence than manslaughter  because someone who murders intends to kill (or at least cause the victim  serious harm), while someone who commits manslaughter does not.  Mr. Goforth appealed to Saskatchewan’s Court of Appeal, which set aside  his convictions and ordered a new trial. The Court of Appeal said the trial  judge made errors in her instructions to the jury in two ways. First, she was  wrong in how she described the guilty mind requirement, known as the “<em>mens rea</em>”. Second, she failed to properly  instruct the jury regarding Mr. Goforth’s evidence that he was only a secondary  caregiver to the children. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court agreed with the Crown.  <strong>The jury was properly  instructed. </strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice  Suzanne Côté said the jury was properly instructed. “This Court has long held that an accused is  entitled to a jury that is properly — and not necessarily  perfectly — instructed”, she wrote. Trial judges must be allowed  some flexibility in the language they use to instruct a jury since their role  is to simplify the law and evidence. An appeal court must review any alleged  errors in the instructions in the context of the evidence, the entire jury instructions  and the trial as a whole.  In this case, the trial judge’s instructions were not perfect but were adequate.  The majority of judges said there was no reasonable possibility that the jury would  have been confused about the <em>mens rea</em> requirement or been misled about what the Crown had to prove for Mr. Goforth to  be found guilty of either manslaughter or unlawfully causing bodily harm.  Also, the trial judge’s instructions were sufficient as to Mr. Goforth’s  evidence relating to his busy schedule and that he was only a secondary  caregiver, which he argued prevented him from foreseeing the risk of harm to  the children. Finally, the judge’s instructions necessarily allowed the jury to  make a common sense assessment about whether failing to provide food and water  to young children was a marked departure (significantly different) from what a  reasonably prudent person would do.

2022 SCC 24,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules a grandmother should have custody over a child despite the  father’s closer biological tie. </strong>
   The father and mother  were married in 2012 in Alberta. They separated less than a year later when the  mother moved to Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.). The father was unaware the  mother was pregnant when she left. Shortly after the child was born in 2013,  the maternal grandmother went to reside with the mother and child to help  support them. When the child was four years old, the mother refused to allow  the grandmother further contact with him. The child was then apprehended by the  Director of Child Protection, as he was found to be needing protection. He was  eventually placed in the grandmother’s care. The Director subsequently alerted  the father of the child’s existence. The father and the grandmother applied for  permanent custody separately from each other.  The hearing judge held  it was in the child’s best interests for the grandmother to have custody. The  father appealed to the Court of Appeal of P.E.I., which gave him custody. The  grandmother then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has said  the grandmother should have custody.  <strong>The standard of review to be applied by appeal  courts in child protection cases</strong>
     Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice  Sheilah Martin said the grandmother should have custody. The Court of Appeal should  have deferred to the hearing judge’s decision in this regard, Justice Martin  explained.  The most important consideration  in a child custody case is the best interests of the child. A judge’s ruling on a child custody matter is owed  deference when reviewed by an appeal court. An appeal court may only change  a ruling if there was a material error, a serious misapprehension of the  evidence, or an error in law. The  same standard applies in custody cases involving child protection, unless there  is legislation to the contrary. Nothing in P.E.I.’s <em>Child Protection Act</em> suggests a different standard. In this case, the  Supreme Court found no error in the hearing judge’s assessment of the best  interests of the child. The hearing judge based her analysis on an extensive  review of the evidence, and was not compelled to decide in favour of the father  simply due to a closer biological tie.  <strong>Biological ties carry minimal weight in the  assessment of a child’s best interests</strong>
     A parent’s biological tie  is simply one factor among many that may be relevant to a child’s best interest,  Justice Martin said. Judges are not required to treat biology as a tie-breaker  when two prospective custodial applicants are otherwise equal. Placing too  great an emphasis on a biological tie could lead some judges to give effect to  the parent’s claim over the child’s best interests. Parental preferences should  not prevail over the child’s best interests. “While biological ties may be  relevant in a given case, they will generally carry minimal weight in the  assessment of a child’s best interests”, Justice Martin wrote. "
2022 SCC 23,"<strong>The Supreme Court finds  unconstitutional the section of the <em>Criminal Code</em> that permits consecutive parole  ineligibility periods of 25 years in cases involving multiple first degree murders.</strong>
   On the evening of January 29, 2017, Alexandre Bissonnette entered the  Great Mosque of Québec armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a pistol and  opened fire on the worshippers. He killed six people and seriously injured five  others. At trial, he pled guilty to all charges against him, including six  counts of first degree murder.  The sentence for first degree murder in Canada is imprisonment for life  without the possibility of parole for 25 years. When someone is found guilty of  multiple first degree murders, the same 25-year sentence applies to each murder.  Usually, offenders serve each of their sentences at the same time (concurrently),  but at trial the Crown prosecutor asked the judge to apply section 745.51 of  the <em>Criminal Code</em>. This provision allows  the periods without eligibility for parole for each murder conviction to be  served back-to-back (consecutively). This would have meant the offender would serve  six consecutive parole ineligibility periods of 25 years, for a total of 150  years. But counsel for the offender argued the provision is unconstitutional. The  trial judge agreed and ordered the offender to serve five of the 25-year  sentences concurrently, as well as 15 years for the sixth first degree murder  to be served consecutively, for a total ineligibility period of 40 years.  The offender appealed his sentence to Quebec’s Court of Appeal, which also  found the provision unconstitutional, but ordered the offender to serve the six  sentences concurrently, for a total ineligibility period of 25 years. The Crown  then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  <strong>Section 745.51 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>violates section 12 of <em>Charter</em> and is therefore  unconstitutional. </strong>
     Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Chief Justice Richard Wagner  said section 745.51 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> violates section 12 of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> in a way that cannot be justified in a free  and democratic society. Section 12 of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Its  purpose is to protect human dignity and ensure respect for the inherent worth  of each individual.  In a case of multiple murders, section 745.51 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> allows a court to impose  imprisonment on the offender without a possibility of parole for a period of  50, 75, 100 or even 150 years. This provision “authorizes a court to order an  offender to serve an ineligibility period that exceeds the life expectancy of  any human being, a sentence so absurd that it would bring the administration of  justice into disrepute”, the Chief Justice wrote.  A life sentence without a realistic possibility of parole presupposes the  offender is beyond redemption and cannot be rehabilitated. This is degrading in  nature and incompatible with human dignity. It amounts to cruel and unusual  punishment. “By depriving offenders in advance of any possibility of  reintegration into society, section 745.51 shakes the very foundations of  Canadian criminal law”, the Chief Justice said.  In light of this conclusion, the Chief Justice declared section 745.51 invalid  from the time it was enacted in 2011. As a result, the law that existed before  that date continues to apply. This means the offender must serve a life sentence  without eligibility for parole for a total of 25 years. "
2022 SCC 22,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules children can  relocate within British Columbia to live with their mother. </strong>
   This is a child custody case. The mother  and father met in 2011. Soon after, the mother moved to Kelowna, where the  father was living. They got married, bought a house and had two boys. When  their relationship ended in 2018, the mother took the children to her parents’  home in Telkwa, a 10-hour drive from Kelowna.  The children split their time between  Telkwa and Kelowna before the parents agreed the children should remain in  Kelowna with the father until the mother returned there, although she never did  return. Instead, she asked the court to relocate the children to Telkwa. If  not, she said she was willing to move to Kelowna, but the father was unwilling  to move to Telkwa.  At trial, the judge said the children could  move to Telkwa with the mother for two reasons: the bitter relationship between  the parents affected the children; and the father might not be able to afford  to stay in the Kelowna home. The father then appealed to British Columbia’s  Court of Appeal, asking to present additional evidence about his financial  situation.  The Court of Appeal sided with the father.  It allowed the new evidence, saying it affected the trial judge’s finding about  the father’s finances. As a result, the relocation could no longer be  justified. The mother then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has sided with the  mother.  <strong>The  new evidence should not have been allowed on appeal. </strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges of  the Supreme Court, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis said the children can move  to Telkwa with their mother. The majority said the Court of Appeal was  wrong to apply a different test than that set out by the Supreme Court in <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2543/index.do"">Palmer  v. The Queen</a></em> when deciding whether the father could present new  evidence. As the majority explained, this test applies to evidence even at the  appeal stage. According to the test, four criteria must be met for the evidence  to be allowed: (1) despite the party’s due diligence, the evidence could not  have been presented at trial; (2) the evidence is relevant; (3) it is credible;  and (4) it could have affected the result at trial.  In this case, the test was not met because  the evidence about the father’s finances could have been presented at trial if  he had taken all reasonable steps to obtain it in time.  <strong>The  move is in the children’s best interests.  </strong>
     The majority said there was no reason for  the Court of Appeal to change the trial judge’s decision. The move was in the  children’s best interests. There was a significant risk that the bitter  relationship between the parents would affect the children if they stayed in  Kelowna. Also, the mother needed her parents’ help to care for the children,  and they are in Telkwa.  In such cases, the question is “whether relocation  is in the best interests of the child, having regard to child’s physical,  emotional and psychological safety, security and well-being”, the majority  said. The analysis is highly fact-specific and discretionary, and the possibility  for change on appeal is very narrow. "
2022 SCC 19,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms a man’s  acquittals and the Court of Appeal’s order for a new trial for another man in  cases involving automatism. </strong>
   These cases are about two Ontario men, David  Sullivan and Thomas Chan, who committed violent acts while extremely intoxicated  from drugs they had voluntary taken. The events are unrelated, but both men argued  that the drugs left them in states of “automatism”. Automatism is when someone  claims to have been so intoxicated or impaired that they lost complete control  of themselves. Mr. Sullivan took an overdose of a  prescription drug, fell into an impaired state and attacked his mother with a  knife, gravely injuring her. He was charged with several offences, including  aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.  Mr. Chan took “magic mushrooms”, which contain a drug called  psilocybin. He fell into an impaired state, attacked his father with a knife  and killed him, and seriously injured his father’s partner. Mr. Chan was tried  for manslaughter and aggravated assault. In addition to the defence of  automatism, he said an underlying brain injury was also to blame for his  actions.  Section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> prevents a person from using automatism as a defence  for crimes involving assault or interference with the bodily integrity of  another person. At their respective trials, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Chan argued  that section 33.1 violates sections 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (<em>Charter</em>). Section 7 guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty  and security of the person, whereas section 11(d) guarantees everyone the right  to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.  In Mr. Sullivan’s case, the trial judge  accepted that he was acting involuntarily, but said section 33.1 prevented the  defence of automatism and convicted him. In Mr. Chan’s case, a different trial  judge said he did not have to follow previous decisions of the same court declaring  section 33.1 unconstitutional. He also said Mr. Chan’s brain injury was not the  cause of his actions. As a result, he convicted Mr. Chan. Both men appealed to the Ontario Court of  Appeal, which heard the appeals together. The Court of Appeal acquitted Mr.  Sullivan and ordered a new trial for Mr. Chan since no actual finding of fact  had been made about automatism in his case. The Crown then appealed both  rulings to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals.  <strong>In <em>R. v. Brown</em>, the Supreme Court decided section  33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> was unconstitutional. </strong>
     Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice  Nicholas Kasirer said the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em><a href=""39781-eng.aspx"">R.  v. Brown</a></em>, which was heard together with these appeals and whose  judgment is being rendered at the same time, is applicable to this case. In <em><a href=""39781-eng.aspx"">R.  v. Brown</a></em>, the Court says section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> violates sections 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> in a way that cannot be  justified in a free and democratic society and is unconstitutional. In this  case, Mr. Sullivan can be acquitted because he had proven that he was  intoxicated to the point of automatism and the trial judge had found he was  acting involuntarily. For his part, Mr. Chan can argue the automatism defence at  his new trial, Justice Kasirer explained.  <strong>The effect of a  declaration of unconstitutionality by one trial court on another within the  same province </strong><br/>
     In this case, the Supreme Court also addressed the  question of whether a declaration of unconstitutionality by a trial court is  binding on other courts within the same province. The Court said a decision is indeed  binding on other trial courts, unless the facts are very different or if the  court had no practical way of knowing the decision existed. "
2022 SCC 18,"<strong>The Supreme Court restores an Alberta  man’s acquittal for attacking a woman while in a state of automatism. </strong>
   On the night of January 12, 2018, Matthew  Winston Brown consumed alcohol and “magic mushrooms” at a party in Calgary,  Alberta. The mushrooms contain psilocybin, an illegal drug that can cause  hallucinations. Mr. Brown lost his grip on reality, left the party and broke  into a nearby home, violently attacking a woman inside. The woman suffered  permanent injuries as a result of the attack. When Mr. Brown broke into another  house, the couple living there called the police. Mr. Brown said he had no  memory of the incidents. Mr. Brown was charged with aggravated assault, breaking  and entering, and mischief to property. He had no previous criminal record and  no history of mental illness.  At trial, Mr. Brown pleaded not guilty to the  charges of “automatism”. Automatism is when someone claims to have been so intoxicated  or impaired that they had lost complete control of themselves.  The Crown argued Mr. Brown could not rely on automatism  because section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> prevents a person from using automatism as a defence for crimes involving  assault or interference with the bodily integrity of another person. Mr. Brown responded that section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>violates sections 7 and 11(d)  of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em>. Section 7 guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty and  security of the person, whereas section 11(d) guarantees everyone the right to  be presumed innocent until proven guilty. The judge agreed with Mr. Brown and  acquitted him. The Crown appealed to Alberta’s Court of Appeal, which disagreed  and convicted Mr. Brown. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has restored the acquittal.        The Supreme Court heard this case together with <em><a href=""39270-eng.aspx"">R. v. Sullivan</a></em>,  and the judgments are being rendered at the same time.  <strong>Section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> violates sections 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> and is therefore unconstitutional. </strong>
   Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice  Nicholas Kasirer said section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> violates sections 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> in a way that cannot be justified in a free and democratic  society and is unconstitutional. He wrote that section 33.1 violates section  11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> because society  could interpret someone’s intent to become intoxicated as an intention to  commit a violent offence. Section 33.1 also violates section 7 because a person  could be convicted without the prosecution having to prove that the action was  voluntary or that the person intended to commit the offence. Convicting someone for how they conducted  themselves while in a state of automatism violates principles of fundamental  justice. Our criminal justice system is based on the notion of personal  responsibility. In Canada, two elements of fundamental justice are required for  a person to be found guilty of a crime. They are: a guilty action; and (2) a guilty  mind. Neither element is present when a person is in a state of automatism.  <strong>Parliament could enact legislation to address violence caused by extreme  intoxication. </strong>
     The Court explained that Parliament could enact  new legislation to hold an extremely intoxicated person accountable for a  violent crime. The Court emphasized that, “protecting the victims of violent  crime – particularly in light of the equality and dignity interests of women  and children who are vulnerable to intoxicated sexual and domestic acts – is a  pressing and substantial social purpose”. "
2022 SCC 17,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules the delay for  the retrial of a Quebec father charged with multiple sex offences was  reasonable. </strong>
   In 2011, J.F. was charged with seven counts of sexual offences  involving his daughter committed between 1986 and 2001 in Quebec. Following a  preliminary inquiry, J.F.’s trial began before the Court of Québec in late 2013. Meanwhile, in 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada issued its ruling in <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16057/index.do"">R.  v. Jordan</a></em>. In that case, the Supreme Court established limits on  the amount of time between a person being charged and the conclusion of their  trial. The limit is 30 months for a trial in a provincial court, such as the  Court of Québec, following a preliminary inquiry.  Eventually, J.F.’s trial ended with his acquittal in 2017, six years  after he was charged. The Crown appealed to Quebec’s Court of Appeal, which ordered  a new trial. Before the retrial began, J.F. asked the court to stop or “stay” the  proceedings. He argued that the delays during his first trial and before his retrial  were unreasonable. Due to these delays, J.F. argued his right under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (<em>Charter</em>) “to be tried within a  reasonable time”, was violated. The retrial judge agreed with J.F. that his section 11(b) <em>Charter</em> right had been violated. The  Crown appealed to Quebec’s Court of Appeal. The judges on that court ruled that  the delay for each trial must be considered separately. They said that it would  only be necessary to consider the delay for the retrial, if the delay for the  first trial were reasonable. In J.F.’s case, however, the first trial delay was  unreasonable. So the Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeal and did not  consider the retrial delay. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has sided with the Crown.  <strong>Only the delay for the retrial  is counted. </strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Chief  Justice Richard Wagner said the <em>Jordan</em> decision requires both the Crown and the defence lawyers to act in a timely  manner. This includes the accused raising an issue of delay promptly. As a result,  in the case of a single trial, an accused who believes their right to be tried  within a reasonable time has been violated must raise the issue before their  trial. Sometimes an accused may raise the issue on appeal, but that would be  exceptional. An accused should not raise the delay for their first trial after  an appeal court has ordered a retrial.  Once an appeal court has ordered a retrial, the Chief Justice said only  the delay for that retrial counts, and the same time limit as set out in the<em> Jordan</em> case applies. A delay from the  first trial will be considered in exceptional circumstances only. In this case, J.F. did not raise the delay issue before or during his  first trial, and he did not raise it at the Court of Appeal. He only raised it  at his retrial. So only the delay for the retrial can be considered. That delay  was 10 months and 5 days, which is well below the 30-month limit. As such, it was  reasonable, and there is no reason to stay the proceedings.  "
2022 SCC 16,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that police  violated a Quebec man’s right to a lawyer when he was arrested for murder. </strong>
   Patrick Dussault was arrested by police in Gatineau, Quebec, in August 2013  and charged with murder and arson. The police informed him of his right to  counsel under section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (<em>Charter</em>).  Section 10(b) provides that “everyone has the right on arrest or detention to  retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right”. At the police station, Mr. Dussault spoke to a lawyer on the phone who  explained the charges against him and his right to remain silent. When the  lawyer had the impression that Mr. Dussault did not understand, he offered to come  to the station and to continue the conversation in person. Mr. Dussault agreed  and the police approved the lawyer’s visit. In the meantime, the lawyer told Mr. Dussault not to speak to anyone until  he arrived at the station. He also asked the police to suspend their  investigation until he was present. Yet when the lawyer arrived, the police did  not allow him to see Mr. Dussault. Instead, they told Mr. Dussault the lawyer was  not at the station. The police proceeded to interrogate Mr. Dussault. The  accused then made an incriminating statement that was later used against him in  court. Mr. Dussault pleaded guilty to the arson charge and a jury trial was  held to decide the murder charge.  At trial, Mr. Dussault asked the judge to exclude the incriminating  statement from the evidence. He argued that it violated his right to counsel  under section 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. The  trial judge disagreed and admitted the statement. The jury eventually convicted  Mr. Dussault of murder. He then appealed to Quebec’s Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal found that police had violated Mr. Dussault’s section  10(b) <em>Charter </em>right and ordered a new  murder trial. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  <strong>Mr. Dussault’s  section 10(b) <em>Charter </em>right was violated.</strong>
     Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Michael Moldaver said police  failed to provide Mr. Dussault with a further opportunity to speak with his  lawyer before they interrogated him. As a result, his section 10(b) <em>Charter</em> right was violated. An initial conversation between the accused and a lawyer normally  satisfies the right to counsel. But if the police cause the accused to doubt  the legal advice received or the trustworthiness of the lawyer who provided it,  the police must provide the accused another opportunity to speak with a lawyer.  In this case, the Supreme Court found that the police caused Mr.  Dussault to doubt his lawyer’s advice. It said they led Mr. Dussault to believe  that: (1) an in-person meeting would happen when his lawyer arrived at the  station; and (2) his lawyer had not come to the station. This “was one of those  rare cases in which the police were obligated to provide the accused with a  second opportunity to consult counsel”, wrote Justice Moldaver. "
2022 SCC 15,"<strong>The Supreme Court restores the 2017  convictions of an individual who was found guilty of multiple sex offences  against children. </strong>
   In 2012, J.D.  was charged with 18 counts of sexual offences involving young people committed  between 1974 and 1993 in Quebec. Two of the complainants were his children  (C.D. and S.D.). The trial by judge alone (without a jury) started in 2016. J.D.’s  daughter (C.D.) testified over two days. Soon after, the judge fell ill and the  trial was postponed. Section 669.2(3)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> sets out what  should happen if a judge cannot continue a trial but has not yet rendered a  verdict. In this case, a new trial was started before another judge. At the new  trial in 2017, the parties agreed to file the original transcript of C.D’s  testimony so that she would not have to testify again. The new judge also heard  testimony from the other complainants and found J.D. guilty on nine counts of  sexual offences.  J.D. appealed  to Quebec’s Court of Appeal, which ordered a new trial on the counts concerning  his two children. The court said the trial judge should have conducted a  two-part test before permitting C.D.’s initial testimony to be filed as  evidence at the new trial. The judges said the test would have ensured that the  accused truly agreed with the decision to file the testimony and that the  filing would not affect the fairness of the trial. The Crown then appealed to  the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme  Court has sided with the Crown.  <strong>A transcript of witness testimony given at  a first trial can be filed as evidence in a second trial if the parties agree.</strong>
     Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Suzanne Côté said the law does not require the new  judge to conduct a test before allowing a transcript of witness testimony given  at a first trial to be filed as evidence at a second trial, if the parties  agree.  Justice Côté  said section 669.2(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> is clear. Where a trial is by judge alone, the new judge must begin the trial  again as if no evidence had been taken, and cannot require the parties to file  evidence from the first trial. Instead, both the prosecution and the defence  can present their evidence as they see fit. For example, they may choose, as  they did in this case, to file a transcript of previous testimony. This is a  strategic decision like choosing to cross-examine a witness, and the judge  should not intervene. “All that is needed is that the transcript be duly filed  and that the parties consent to it being filed”, Justice Côté wrote. In this case,  the new judge did not require the parties to file the transcript from the first  trial. Rather, the parties agreed between themselves to file it. There was no reason  for the judge to question the accused’s consent in this regard. As a result,  the second trial was fair."
2022 SCC 12,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds an Alberta  man’s conviction for drug and firearm offences despite a police error. </strong>
   On October 8, 2016, Sokha Tim hit a road sign on a busy street in  Calgary, Alberta and kept driving. When police found him about one kilometre away,  the officer asked to see his driver’s license, vehicle registration and proof  of insurance. While Mr. Tim searched for the documents, the officer saw him try  to hide a zip-lock bag containing a single yellow pill. The officer correctly  identified the pill as gabapentin, a prescription drug, but mistakenly believed  it was a controlled substance. After the officer arrested Mr. Tim, he and  another officer searched him and his car, and found illegal drugs, ammunition  and a loaded handgun.  Mr. Tim was charged with drug and firearm offences. At trial, he said the  police had no basis to arrest or search him because the officer was mistaken  about the legal status of gabapentin. As a result, he argued the police had  violated his rights under sections 8 and 9 of the <em>Canadian</em> <em>Charter of Rights  and Freedoms (Charter).</em> Section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> protects people from “unreasonable search or seizure” and  section 9 protects people from “arbitrary detention”. The trial judge dismissed  his arguments and admitted the evidence.  Convicted on all charges, Mr. Tim appealed to Alberta’s Court of  Appeal, which found no violation of his <em>Charter</em> rights. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  <strong>Mr. Tim’s <em>Charter</em> rights were violated, but the evidence could be admitted  nonetheless. </strong>
     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Mahmud  Jamal said police violated Mr. Tim’s section 9 <em>Charter</em> right by arresting him based on a mistake about the legal  status of gabapentin. “Allowing the police to arrest based on what they believe  the law is — rather than based on what the law actually is — would dramatically  expand police powers at the expense of civil liberties”, he wrote. Justice  Jamal also said because Mr. Tim’s arrest was unlawful, the searches of him and  his car that followed also violated his section 8 <em>Charter</em> right.  When evidence is obtained in a manner that violates an accused’s <em>Charter </em>rights, courts must conduct an analysis  to determine if the evidence could still be admitted, or whether its admission  would harm or “bring the administration of justice into disrepute”. In this  case, Justice Jamal said the violations were less serious and only moderately  impacted Mr. Tim’s <em>Charter</em>-protected  interests. On the other hand, the evidence was reliable and essential to the  prosecution of serious offences. Weighing these considerations, Justice Jamal said  the evidence could be admitted. As a result, the Court has upheld Mr. Tim’s  convictions.  <strong>The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em></strong>
     The <em>Charter</em> is part of  Canada’s Constitution and protects various rights and freedoms. It came into  force 40 years ago, on April 17, 1982.  Since that time, Canadian courts have decided a wide range of legal questions  where they interpret and apply the <em>Charter</em>.  In criminal cases such as this one, the <em>Charter </em>helps clarify police powers in relation to the rights of the accused. "
2022 SCC 11,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules police did  not violate an Ontario man’s privacy when they searched his home.</strong>
  On June 1, 2017, police in  Oakville, Ontario responded to a report about a man hitting a woman in a car. The  man was later identified as Matthew Stairs. Police found the car parked in the driveway  with no one inside, so they knocked on the front door of the house. When no one  answered, the officers entered through a side door. Inside, they found a woman  with a bruised face. They found and arrested Mr. Stairs in the basement. Police  then looked around the basement living room and found drugs (methamphetamine).  Mr. Stairs was charged with  possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and with assault and breach  of probation. At trial, Mr. Stairs argued that police were not allowed to  search his home and therefore that the drug evidence could not be used against  him. He invoked section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>,  which protects people from “unreasonable search or seizure”. Police testified they  searched the basement living room to address their safety concerns.  Mr. Stairs was convicted of all  charges. He appealed his drug conviction to Ontario’s Court of Appeal, which found  the police search had not violated his section 8 <em>Charter</em> right. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal.  <strong>The search did not violate Mr. Stairs’ section 8 <em>Charter</em> right. </strong>
     Writing for a majority of the  judges of the Supreme Court, Justices Moldaver and Jamal said the search of the  basement living room did not violate Mr. Stairs’ section 8 <em>Charter </em>right. Police had reason to suspect a safety risk, and that  that their concerns would be addressed by a quick scan of the room.  The judges said the search of the  basement living room complied with section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> because: (1) Mr. Stairs’ arrest was lawful; (2) the search  was related to his arrest, was of the surrounding area only and was conducted for  safety reasons; and (3) the search accounted for the increased privacy interests  in a home. As a result, the drug evidence could be admitted at trial. “A fundamental and longstanding  principle of a free society is that a person’s home is their castle”, the  judges wrote. They added that this privacy interest must be balanced with valid  law enforcement objectives. In other words, police can search a home for safety  reasons if the search is conducted in a reasonable manner and accounts for the  greater expectation of privacy in a person’s home."
2022 SCC 10,"<strong>The  Supreme Court upholds a fine of more than $9 million for a Quebec maple syrup  thief.  </strong>
  The robbery was discovered in July 2012 when the 
    <span lang=""fr"" xml:lang=""fr"">Fédération des  producteurs acéricoles du Québec </span>
  (Federation) did a routine inventory check at  its warehouse in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford and found barrels containing water  instead of maple syrup. The Federation controls the production of maple syrup  in Quebec. The Quebec provincial police arrested 16 people, including Mr. Richard  Vallières.  Mr. Vallières was  found guilty of fraud, trafficking and theft. The stolen syrup was worth  over $18 million. But during  his trial in Quebec Superior Court, he said he sold the syrup for $10 million  and made a personal profit of around $1 million.  The judge sentenced Mr.  Vallières to eight years in prison and fined him over $9 million. The judge  ordered this fine based on section 462.37(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which says a fine must be equal to the value of the  stolen property when that property cannot be returned to its owner. This is  called a “fine in lieu”.  Mr. Vallières appealed  to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. It reduced the fine to around $1 million,  which was Mr. Vallières’ profit.  The Crown then  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing the Court of Appeal should not  have reduced the fine.   The Supreme Court has  sided with the Crown.  <strong>A court cannot limit the amount of a fine to  the profit made by an offender. </strong>
    Writing for a  unanimous Court, Chief Justice Wagner said the wording of section 462.37(3) of  the <em>Criminal Code</em> is clear: Mr.  Vallières must pay a fine equal to the value of the stolen syrup. This amounted  to more than $9 million (in other words, $10 million for which he sold the  syrup minus the amount he owed to the Federation under a separate court order).  Mr. Vallières has 10 years to pay this fine or else he must serve six years in  prison. Given the wording of section 462.37(3), a court does not have the  discretion (power) to limit a fine to the profit made. So, the Court of Appeal was  wrong in this case to reduce Mr. Vallières’ fine to $1 million.  The Chief Justice explained  that Parliament adopted section 462.37(3) for two reasons: not allowing an  offender to profit from their crime and discouraging them from repeating the  offence. This provision is severe because Parliament wanted to send a clear  message that “crime  does not pay”. In cases where more  than one person had possession or control of the stolen property, a court can  divide the value of that property among them in order to avoid the owner  getting more money in return than they should. An offender must ask the court  to divide the amount, and the court must be able to do so based on the evidence.  In this case, the Chief Justice said Mr. Vallières had not proven at trial, or even  on appeal, that the $10 million should be divided between him and the other thieves.  As a result, the trial judge had no choice but to order him to pay the full  amount.  "
2021 SCC 9,"<strong>The  Supreme Court upholds the conviction of a man arrested with a gun at a Toronto  nightclub, despite an error by the trial judge<em>. </em></strong>
   This is a criminal case  about whether the accused had a fair trial. Mr. Samaniego and another man (his  co-accused) went one evening to a nightclub in Toronto called Las Brisas. The  security guard allowed the co-accused into the club, as they were good friends.  However, the security guard did not allow Mr. Samaniego in because he had  threatened him in the past. Later in the evening, the police were called about  a gun at Las Brisas. They arrested Mr. Samaniego and the co-accused for  possession of a loaded restricted firearm.  At trial, the Crown called  the security guard as a witness. The security guard testified that Mr.  Samaniego threatened him when he did not allow him into the club and showed him  a gun tucked into his waistband. The guard also testified that the co-accused  came out of the club to resolve the situation, took the gun away from Mr.  Samaniego and then went back in, but later came out again, dropped the gun in  front of the guard and picked it back up. The Crown’s position was that both  men had the gun at some point. In defence, Mr.  Samaniego’s lawyer argued that only the co-accused had possession of the gun  and that the security guard was lying to protect the co-accused because he was  his friend.  During the trial, the  judge made four rulings that limited the questions the security guard could be  asked, including questions about who dropped the gun and who picked it up. The jury  eventually convicted Mr. Samaniego. Mr. Samaniego appealed  his conviction to the Court of Appeal. He argued the trial judge’s rulings were  wrong. A majority of the Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that the trial  judge’s rulings were trial management decisions and did not affect the fairness  of the trial. Mr. Samaniego then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The accused had a fair  trial despite an error in one of the trial judge’s rulings. </strong>  Writing for the majority, Justice Moldaver said  one of the four rulings was wrong in part. It was the ruling that limited the  questions Mr. Samaniego’s lawyer could ask the security guard about who dropped  the gun and who picked it up. Justice Moldaver said that ruling was both a  trial management ruling and an evidentiary ruling. As he explained, judges can  make rulings to ensure that trials are well run. These are known as “trial  management rulings”. “Evidentiary rulings” relate to the admissibility of  evidence, requiring the judge to apply the rules of evidence. Sometimes these  two types of rulings overlap.  During the preliminary inquiry, the  security guard had told a different story at first about who dropped the gun  and who picked it up. He later changed his story and repeated the same account  he had told police and at the trial. Mr. Samaniego’s lawyer was wanting to show the guard had  said one thing at the preliminary inquiry and another at the trial. This was not  true, and the trial management part of this ruling was to prevent that.  As to the security guard saying  different things during the preliminary inquiry, the trial judge should have  allowed Mr. Samaniego’s lawyer to question him about it. That evidentiary part  of the ruling was wrong. The fact the guard eventually changed his story did  not erase his first version of events. This was an inconsistency that the  lawyer could ask him about.  Although the ruling was wrong in  part, the error caused no harm to Mr. Samaniego. His lawyer was still able to  challenge the security guard’s credibility. As a result, the majority judges ruled  Mr. Samaniego had a fair trial and they upheld his conviction. "
2022 SCC 6,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an Alberta First Nation could  qualify to have its legal fees paid in advance by the government despite having  funds of its own. <em>  </em></strong>
  The question in this case is whether  an Alberta First Nation qualifies for “advance costs”. Advance costs means a party’s legal fees are  paid in advance by the government in order to allow the case to continue when it  is a matter of public interest.  This case involves the Beaver  Lake Cree Nation (Beaver Lake) of northeastern Alberta whose members are  beneficiaries of Treaty No. 6, which means they have the right to hunt and fish  on their traditional lands. More than a decade ago, Beaver Lake sued the governments  of Canada and Alberta for damages due to industrial development on those lands,  including oil and gas wells. Since then, there have been many preliminary court  proceedings, and the case has yet to go to trial. But Beaver Lake has already  paid $3 million in legal fees and says it cannot afford to pay more. As a  result, it asked the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta to award it advance  costs.  The Court of Queen’s Bench  accepted the request and ordered Canada and Alberta to each contribute $300,000  annually to Beaver Lake’s legal costs until the trial is over. This was the  same amount as Beaver Lake would also contribute annually. The Court of Appeal of  Alberta reversed that order because Beaver Lake had not proven it could not  afford the ongoing litigation. Beaver Lake then appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada.  The Supreme Court has ruled that  Beaver Lake could qualify for advance costs should it not be able to pay its  legal fees.  <strong>A First Nation could qualify for advance costs despite having funds of  its own, if it cannot afford to pay its legal fees nonetheless. </strong>
     Writing for a unanimous Court,  Justices Karakatsanis and Brown explained that advance costs are rarely awarded. However, a party that has funds  of its own could still qualify for advance costs if it satisfies the test for “impecuniosity”. Impecuniosity means not  having enough money to pay. It is one of the three requirements for advance  costs set out by the Supreme Court in 2003 in <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2106/index.do"">British  Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band</a></em>. The other two requirements are not  disputed by the parties in this case.  The Supreme Court said the test for  impecuniosity is not easily met. An applicant must demonstrate that it cannot  afford to pay its legal fees given its other pressing needs and that the case would  therefore not continue. A court’s analysis must be based on the evidence. The  court must be able to: (1) identify the applicant’s pressing needs; (2) determine  what resources are required to meet those needs; (3) assess the applicant’s financial  resources; and (4) identify the estimated costs of the litigation. The Supreme Court  said that in cases such as this one, pressing needs must be understood in the spirit of reconciliation and from  the perspective of a First Nation, because it would have its own spending  priorities.  <strong>The case has been sent  back to the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta for a new hearing.  </strong>The judges of the Supreme  Court concluded there  was not enough  evidence on the record before the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta to decide  Beaver Lake’s application for advance costs. As such, the judges decided to  send the case back to that court for a new hearing. This will enable the Court of Queen’s Bench to consider all relevant  evidence, including Beaver  Lake’s current financial situation.

2023 SCC 34,"<strong>The Supreme Court sets aside the  conviction of a man found guilty of first-degree murder and orders a new trial. </strong>This case is about whether the judge in a murder trial  correctly instructed the jury with respect to the accused’s mental health  conditions and his post-offence conduct.   On April 9, 2014, Mr. Derrick Michael Lawlor participated  in a sexual encounter with two other men in a park in Kitchener, Ontario. The  following day, the body of one of those men was found in the park. He had died  due to external neck compression. Mr. Lawlor had consumed both psychiatric medication  and alcohol around the time he was in the park with the victim and the third  man. He had made several statements both before and after the victim’s death  about how he wanted to harm and kill gay men, and that he had at times carried  a rope and a knife to do so. In the days following the killing, Mr. Lawlor also  searched the internet for news with respect to the discovery of a body in the  park.Mr. Lawlor was tried by a judge and jury. In the  judge’s instructions to the jury on the element of intent, which is required to  find an accused guilty of first-degree murder, the trial judge did not  specifically highlight any evidence related to Mr. Lawlor’s mental health. Such  evidence could have impacted whether he intended to commit the offence. Rather,  he asked the jury to consider “all of the evidence”, including Mr. Lawlor’s  state of mind and any evidence of impairment by drugs and alcohol. The trial  judge also briefly referred to Mr. Lawlor’s internet searches after the offence,  but did not give the jury further instructions to limit what it could infer  from this evidence to determine guilt. The jury ultimately found Mr. Lawlor  guilty of first-degree murder. On appeal before the Ontario Court of Appeal, Mr.  Lawlor did not contest the fact that he caused the victim’s death and  acknowledged he was at least guilty of manslaughter. However, he argued the  trial judge failed to expressly instruct the jury on the use of evidence of his  mental health, which was relevant to determining his intent to commit the  offence. Mr. Lawlor also claimed the trial judge should have provided the jury  with instructions limiting their use of the evidence with respect to his conduct  after the offence. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal. One judge disagreed and would have allowed the appeal  and ordered a new trial. In his view, the considerable evidence on Mr. Lawlor’s  mental health was central to determining whether he had the requisite intent  for murder. He also thought the trial judge should have warned the jury against  drawing incriminating inferences from Mr. Lawlor’s post-offence conduct without  considering alternative explanations as to why he was searching the internet  for news about the victim’s death. <strong>The Supreme Court has </strong><strong>allowed the appeal. </strong>As a result, Mr. Lawlor’s  conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered.

2023 SCC 33,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds a  constable’s conviction for aggravated assault.</strong> This case is about whether a constable who used force  during an altercation with a person under arrest can rely on a defense under  the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The appellant, Trevor Ian James Lindsay, is a  constable with the Calgary Police Service. In May 2015, he arrested Mr. Daniel  Haworth for theft. Together with another constable, he handcuffed and  transported Mr. Haworth to the Calgary Court Services building in a police  vehicle for processing and an appearance before a Justice of the Peace. Upon arrival, Constable Lindsay removed Mr. Haworth  from the vehicle. They briefly interacted, then became physically engaged.  Video surveillance showed Constable Lindsay punching Mr. Haworth in the face  and head three times, throwing him to the pavement, then both constables  holding him to the ground. Mr. Haworth suffered a skull fracture and a brain  injury as a result of his head striking the pavement. He died a few months  later from an unrelated drug overdose. Constable Lindsay was charged with aggravated assault.  At trial, he relied on section 25 of the <em>Criminal  Code </em>in his defence, which protects peace officers from liability related  to their lawful use of force. He testified that his use of force was to try to  control Mr. Haworth. He said he was terrified that Mr. Haworth would spit blood  or saliva toward him or the other constable, and that either or both officers  could contract a serious infectious disease. With respect to putting Mr.  Haworth on the ground, Constable Lindsay explained that, by mistake, he grabbed  the hood instead of the collar from the hoodie Mr. Haworth was wearing. The  slack between the hood and the collar prevented him from controlling the  descent, resulting in Mr. Haworth contacting the pavement harder than he had  intended.The trial judge concluded that Constable Lindsay’s use  of force was excessive. As such, section 25 of the <em>Code </em>did not protect him from criminal liability. With respect to  the actual offence, the judge did not specifically address whether the Crown  had proven the constable’s aggravated assault beyond a reasonable doubt  because, in his view, the defence had conceded earlier in the trial that the  elements of the offence were present.  A majority of the Court of Appeal agreed with the  trial judge and dismissed the appeal. However, one dissenting judge would have  allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. First, he thought the trial judge  did not decisively determine whether the Crown had proven the assault beyond a  reasonable doubt. Second, he also believed there was an objective basis to  Constable Lindsay’s fear of being spat on, and that his use of force may have  been reasonable. As such, because the trial judge failed to properly evaluate  the reasonableness of the force used, no conclusion could be made as to whether  section 25 applied to the constable’s actions. Constable Lindsay appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada. He asked the Court to determine two issues: (1) whether the Crown had  proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed the crime of aggravated  assault; and (2) whether his use of force on Mr. Haworth was justified under  section 25 of the <em>Code</em>. <strong>The Supreme Court has </strong><strong>dismissed the appeal. </strong>As a result, Constable  Lindsay’s conviction is upheld.Justice Jamal read the judgment of the  Court.

2023 SCC 32,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a criminal trial was fair despite the Crown’s improper arguments to the  jury</strong><strong>.</strong>This case is about  whether a criminal trial was rendered unfair by the trial judge’s failure to  instruct the jury to ignore improper arguments made by Crown counsel on matters  that were not in evidence.  B.E.M., whose name cannot be disclosed due to a  publication ban protecting the victim, was convicted by jury of  historical sexual assault and sexual interference offences against his  stepdaughter between 1995 and 1997, when she was between 13 and 15 years old.The only two  witnesses at the trial were the complainant and B.E.M., who denied the offences.  The credibility of the complainant was a key issue during the trial. The  prosecutor argued that despite some vagueness in her memory, her evidence was  fundamentally believable. In his closing arguments, he offered a personal  anecdote about a memory he had of sustaining head injuries after slipping in a  shower on a camping trip when he was in grade two or three. He explained how  his experience could help demonstrate that the complainant’s evidence was  reliable: “My memory has been sort of shifted but fundamentally the truth of  the experience – the core of the experience is persistent. Remains the same  throughout. And I think that’s what’s happening here.” The trial judge did not  address whether it was improper for the Crown to provide personal experience  about how memory works.B.E.M. appealed his  conviction to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. He argued that the Crown’s  personal anecdote was not based on evidence presented at trial and that the  trial judge’s failure to tell the jury to ignore those arguments resulted in an  unfair trial.   A majority of judges  at the Court of Appeal dismissed B.E.M.’s appeal. They considered four factors  to determine whether the Crown’s comments rendered the trial unfair: the  seriousness of the improper comments; the context in which they were made;  whether defence counsel objected to them (they did not); and any remedial steps  taken by the trial judge after the address or in the instructions to the jury. The  judges acknowledged that the Crown’s anecdote in closing arguments was  improper. However, they concluded there was no risk that it resulted in trial  unfairness. The anecdote was “folksy” rather than disrespectful, exaggerated or  inflammatory. The judges said that arguments on the workings of human memory  were entirely appropriate, and that it was a topic on which the jury was  expected to apply its life experience. The dissenting  judge would have allowed B.E.M.’s appeal. In her view, the Crown’s closing arguments  to the jury were not egregious but were on the key issue of credibility. Given  the importance of this issue to the outcome of the trial, she found the trial  judge’s failure to provide a specific limiting instruction to the jury – in other  words, a caution against misusing the Crown’s anecdote – made the trial unfair.B.E.M. appealed to  the Supreme Court of Canada.<strong>The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.  </strong>As a result, B.E.M.’s conviction is upheld.

2023 SCC 31,"<strong>The Supreme  Court sets aside ministerial decisions refusing to admit children of non‑rights  holder parents to French schools in the Northwest Territories.</strong>This case was about whether the refusal to  admit children of non‑rights holder parents to French‑language schools in the  Northwest Territories gave due consideration to the protections conferred by  section 23 of the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms</em>.Section 23 guarantees certain categories  of Canadian citizens the right to instruction in the minority official language.  The purpose of this provision is to prevent the erosion of official language  communities as well as to redress past injustices and promote the development  of these communities. “Rights  holders” have this constitutional right by virtue of their mother tongue or their  education. Canadian citizens of whom any child has received or is receiving  primary or secondary school instruction in the minority official language have  the right to have all their children receive instruction in that language. “Non‑rights  holders” are people who do not meet the requirements of section 23 and who  therefore do not have this right. In 2016, the Northwest Territories adopted a ministerial directive on enrolment in French first language education  programs that created categories of eligible non‑rights holder parents, including “non‑citizen  francophone” and “new immigrant”.In the Northwest Territories, two public schools currently offer a  French first language education program. In 2018 and 2019, five non‑rights holder parents  applied to the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment for their  children’s admission to a French first language education program. In each  case, the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord‑Ouest  recommended admission because it would promote the development of the Francophone  community of the Northwest Territories. In spite of those recommendations, the  Minister denied each of the applications. In her opinion, the parents did not meet  the conditions established by the directive. She also refused to exercise her residual discretion to admit the children  of the parents in question.The parents and the Commission turned to the  Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories. The judge set  aside the Minister’s decisions and referred the applications for admission back  to her for reconsideration, chiefly because the decisions did not reflect a  proportionate balancing of the protections conferred by section 23 of the <em>Charter</em>. The  Minister appealed the Supreme Court’s judgment to the Court of Appeal for the  Northwest Territories, which restored the decisions that had been set aside. The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the Minister was not  required to consider section 23 in exercising her discretion because the  parents were not rights holders under this provision. The parents and the Commission appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.The Supreme Court of Canada has allowed the  appeal.<strong>The  Minister had to consider section 23 of the <em>Charter</em> in exercising her discretion. </strong>Justice Côté, who wrote the Court’s unanimous  reasons, ruled that the Minister’s decisions had a significant impact on the values enshrined  in section 23 of the <em>Charter</em>, particularlythe  preservation and development of minority language communities. It  follows that these values must therefore always be taken into account, even when  there is no direct infringement of the right guaranteed by s. 23.Justice Côté concluded that the Minister<a> had not proportionately balanced these  values with the government’s interests</a> . In exercising her  discretion, the Minister had attached too much  importance to her duty to make consistent decisions and to the cost of the  contemplated services. Given the remedial nature of section 23, pedagogical  requirements had to have more weight. The Minister’s decisions were therefore  unreasonable. For these reasons, Justice Côté set aside the orders made by the Court  of Appeal. "
2023 SCC 30,"<strong>The Supreme Court declines  to exclude evidence obtained in breach of an accused’s rights in a drug  trafficking case</strong><strong>. </strong><strong></strong>This case is about whether police conduct after an initial traffic  stop breached the accused’s rights under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, and if so, whether the  evidence collected as a result of that police conduct should be excluded from  trial. In February 2017, Mr. George Zacharias was pulled over for a traffic  stop on a highway near Banff, Alberta, because he was driving a truck with a burnt-out  light and illegally tinted windows. The police officer made several  observations during the stop that made him suspicious Mr. Zacharias was  transporting drugs. These observations led the police officer to detain him for  the purpose of asking more questions. This is known as “investigative  detention”. The police officer also called for a sniffer dog and placed Mr.  Zacharias in a police car until the dog arrived. The sniffer dog signaled that  drugs were present. The police officer concluded he had reasonable and probable  grounds to arrest Mr. Zacharias for possession of a controlled substance and  did so. It was the first of three arrests.    The police then searched Mr. Zacharias’ truck and discovered a large  quantity of cannabis and cash. Mr. Zacharias was re-arrested for possession for  the purpose of trafficking, handcuffed and driven to a police detachment. He  was then searched and arrested a third time for possession of proceeds of crime  over $5,000. At trial, Mr. Zacharias alleged the police had breached his rights  under the <em>Charter </em>during the  investigation, namely his right under section 8 to not be subjected to  unreasonable search or seizure, and his right under section 9 to not be  arbitrarily detained. He argued that the drug evidence seized by the police  should be excluded from trial under section 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. This section says that evidence obtained in a way that  breached therights of an accused may  be excluded from trial if admitting it would bring the administration of  justice into disrepute. To determine whether the evidence in question should be  excluded, a court will look at three indicators: (1) the seriousness of the state  conduct in breach of the <em>Charter</em>; (2)  the impact of the breach on the accused; and (3) society’s interest in  adjudicating the matter on its merits.  The trial judge found the police breached Mr. Zacharias’ rights under  sections 8 and 9 of the <em>Charter</em> in conducting a  sniffer search and investigative detention, but held  that the evidence should not be excluded under section 24(2). He was ultimately  convicted of possession of 101.5 pounds of marijuana for the purpose of  trafficking. On appeal before the Court of Appeal of Alberta, Mr. Zacharias  argued the trial judge failed to consider whether the police’s conduct after  these initial violations also breached the <em>Charter</em>.  The majority of judges dismissed his appeal. One judge disagreed and would have  excluded the evidence.   The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The additional <em>Charter </em>breaches did not warrant exclusion  of the evidence.   </strong>Three of the five judges agreed that the additional consequential  breaches did not raise the seriousness of the state conduct at issue (the first  indicator of the section 24(2) analysis). On balance, the evidence should not  be excluded from the trial under section 24(2). Mr. Zacharias’ conviction is  therefore upheld.  "
2023 SCC 29,"<strong>The Supreme Court  dismisses the appeals of four British Columbia residents accused of stock price  manipulation by a Quebec financial authority.    </strong>This case is about whether a Quebec administrative  tribunal had jurisdiction over out-of-province residents accused of fraudulently  manipulating the stock prices of a company with links to Quebec. In 2017, l’Autorité des marchés financiers, an administrative  agency that regulates Quebec’s financial sector, brought an action before the  Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal, an administrative tribunal in Quebec.  It alleged that four residents of British Columbia (the defendants) took part  in a transnational “pump-and-dump” scheme, and in doing so, breached Quebec’s <em>Securities Act</em>, a law designed to protect  the public interest in the securities market. In a pump-and-dump scheme, promoters  boost the price of a stock by releasing false or misleading statements and then  profit by selling their holdings in that stock at much higher prices. In this  case, the defendants allegedly worked together to buy the shares of a shell  company, give it a legitimate face, promote its business, sell its shares for a  profit and distribute this profit among themselves.Despite the defendants being from outside Quebec, the  Autorité des marchés financiers alleged that their scheme had enough ties to the  province to apply Quebec’s securities regulatory scheme to them: the shell  company was a reporting issuer in Quebec with a Montréal business address; its  director was a Quebec resident when the scheme was implemented; its promotional  activities were accessible to Quebec residents; and, ultimately, Quebec  investors lost money. The defendants challenged the action, claiming the Tribunal  did not have jurisdiction over them because they did not live in Quebec. The Tribunal dismissed the defendants’ challenge,  ruling that it had jurisdiction over them under the <em>Act respecting the Autorité des marchés financiers</em>. Section 93 of  that act says the Tribunal has jurisdiction to make determinations under the province’s <em>Securities Act</em>. Together, these acts  form Quebec’s securities regulatory scheme. It also applied the Supreme Court of  Canada’s decision in an unrelated case, which held that a provincial regulatory  scheme, such as the Quebec scheme currently before the Supreme Court in these  appeals, can apply to an out-of-province defendant when there is a “sufficient  connection” or a “real and substantial connection” between the province and the  defendant. What constitutes a “sufficient” connection depends on the  relationship between the province that enacted the legislation, the subject  matter of the legislation and the individual or entity sought to be regulated  by it. The Superior Court of Quebec dismissed the defendants’  requests to review the Tribunal’s decision, concluding the Tribunal had  properly assumed jurisdiction over them. The Court of Appeal of Quebec  dismissed the defendants’ subsequent appeals, but the three judges disagreed on  the legal basis on which to do so. The majority agreed the Tribunal had  jurisdiction because a real and substantial connection existed between the  province and the defendants. The concurring judge would have dismissed the  appeals based on the rules set out in the <em>Civil  Code of Quebec</em> with respect to the international jurisdiction of Quebec  authorities. On appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada, the defendants asked  whether the Tribunal was correct in assuming jurisdiction, and if so, on which  legal basis.The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. <strong>The Tribunal correctly  concluded it had jurisdiction over the defendants. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Jamal said the Tribunal has  jurisdiction to make determinations under the Quebec securities regulatory  scheme. Its jurisdiction can extend to out-of-province defendants when there is  a “real and substantial” connection (also described as a “sufficient  connection”) between them and Quebec. As Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Jamal  wrote, “it would defeat the purpose of the cross-border nature of modern  securities regulation to allow the [defendants] to escape the reach of Quebec’s  regulatory oversight”.The allegations  that the defendants used Quebec as the face of their securities manipulation  and injured Quebec investors establish a sufficient connection to give the Tribunal  jurisdiction over them. For these reasons, Chief Justice Wagner and Justice  Jamal dismissed the appeals. This means the action brought by the Autorité des  marchés financiers against the defendants before the Tribunal can proceed. "
2023 SCC 28,"<strong>The Supreme Court  dismisses the City of Greater Sudbury’s appeal in an occupational health and  safety case<em>.</em></strong>This case arises from a fatal accident and concerns the proper  interpretation of Ontario’s <em>Occupational  Health and Safety Act </em>(the <em>Act</em>).  In September 2015, a pedestrian was struck and killed in Sudbury, Ontario, by  an employee of Interpaving Limited who was driving a road grader, in reverse,  through an intersection. The Corporation of the City of Greater Sudbury had  contracted with Interpaving to act as a constructor to repair a downtown water  main. Contrary to a provincial regulation on construction projects (the  Regulation), no fence was placed between the construction project workplace and  the public intersection, and no signaller was assisting the Interpaving worker.  In separate proceedings, Interpaving was convicted of breaching its duty as an  employer under section 25(1)(c) of the Act to “ensure that…the measures and  procedures prescribed [in the Regulation] are carried out in the workplace”. <strong></strong>The issue in this appeal was whether the City was  liable as an employer for breaching the same duty. The City was charged by the  Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General (Ministry of Labour, Immigration,  Training and Skills Development) under section 25(1)(c). Section 1(1) of the  Act defines an employer as a person who employs or contracts for the services  of one or more workers. The City agreed it was the owner of the construction  project, but denied that it was an employer because it lacked control of the  repair work and had delegated control to Interpaving. The trial judge acquitted the City. In her view, Interpaving,  not the City, had direct control over the workers and the intersection, meaning  the City was not an employer under section 1(1) of the Act. In the alternative,  she determined even if the City had breached its obligations as an employer, she  accepted its defence that it had taken every precaution reasonable in the  circumstances, known as the due diligence defence. The Crown appealed to the  provincial offences appeal court, who upheld the City’s acquittal but did not  address the trial judge’s conclusion on the City’s due diligence defence.  The Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously allowed  the appeal and set aside the decision of the provincial offences appeal court  judge. It applied the definition of “employer” established in an earlier decision  from the Court of Appeal for Ontario – which excluded the control requirement –  to find the City liable under section 25(1)(c) of the Act. It returned the  question of the City’s due diligence defence to the provincial offences appeal  court for determination. The City appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court of Canada has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The City was  liable as an employer for breaching its obligations under section 25(1)(c) of  the Act. </strong>Justice Martin held that the City was an employer of  Interpaving and breached its duty under section 25(1)(c) of the Act. She  determined that nothing in the text, context or purpose of the Act requires the  Crown to establish control over the workers or workplace to prove that the City  breached its obligations as an employer under section 25(1)(c). As she stated,  “diminishing an employer’s duties by reading in a control requirement… would  thwart the purpose of this remedial public welfare legislation”. However, Justice Martin said control is properly  considered in deciding whether an employer who has breached its obligations in  the Act can nevertheless defend itself on the basis that it acted with due  diligence. It is open to an accused – in this case, the City – to prove that  its lack of control suggests it took all reasonable steps in the circumstances.  For these reasons, Justice Martin dismissed the appeal and upheld the Court of  Appeal’s order returning the issue of the City’s due diligence defence to the  provincial offences appeal court for determination.    "
2023 SCC 27,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds  a publication ban in a case setting aside a person’s murder conviction.</strong>This appeal is about whether a publication ban in a  concluded criminal case should be lifted in order to allow the media to report  on a witness affidavit. It is the second time this appeal was brought before  the Supreme Court of Canada. Mr. Frank Ostrowski was convicted of first-degree murder in 1987 and  sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. In 2014, the  federal Minister of Justice asked the Court of Appeal of Manitoba to decide if  there had been a miscarriage of justice at his 1987 trial. In 2018, the Court  of Appeal found that a miscarriage of justice had indeed occurred and set aside  his conviction. During his wrongful conviction proceedings before the  Manitoba Court of Appeal, Mr. Ostrowski sought to enter an affidavit (a sworn  statement) into evidence concerning the death of a witness involved in the  proceedings. The Court of Appeal issued a publication ban over the affidavit. In  its 2018 decision setting aside the Mr. Ostrowski’s conviction, the Court of Appeal  did not accept the affidavit into evidence, but ordered that the publication  ban on its contents remain in effect. In May 2019, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (“CBC”)  asked the Court of Appeal to lift the publication ban by way of a motion. The Court  of Appeal refused, ruling that since it had already decided Mr. Ostrowski’s case,  it no longer had authority to reconsider the publication ban.The CBC appealed the two decisions by the Court of  Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada: the 2018 decision ordering the  publication ban, and the 2019 decision refusing to reconsider the publication  ban. The Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the Court of  Appeal did have the authority to reconsider the ban, and returned the CBC’s  motion to lift the publication ban for determination. The Supreme Court then adjourned  the CBC’s appeal of the ban itself. The Manitoba Court of Appeal went on to dismiss the returned  motion to lift the ban by unanimous decision. The Supreme Court is now considering  the appeal it adjourned in 2021 regarding the 2018 decision. As a general rule, court proceedings are open and  public. This is known as the open court principle, and is protected by the  right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. In light of recent <a href=""../2021/38695-eng.pdf"">jurisprudence</a> from the Supreme Court of Canada on the issue, the CBC asked the Supreme Court  to decide whether publishing the details under the ban would constitute a risk  to the dignity of the people involved so serious that it justifies an exception  to the open court principle. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. The  judgment was delivered orally by Chief Justice Wagner on the day of the  hearing, with written reasons to follow.  <strong>The Court of  Appeal did not make a mistake in issuing the publication ban or in ordering  that it remain in effect. </strong>The Court delivered a unanimous judgment. It said there is a strong  public interest in protecting the privacy of the spouse of the deceased witness  and disclosure of the affidavit would reveal highly sensitive and acutely  personal information that would directly engage the spouse’s dignity interest. Moreover,  the publication ban is necessary to prevent a serious risk to the dignity of  the witness’s spouse, it was not overbroad or vague and there was no reasonable  alternative to its terms. Finally, the Court determined the benefit of the ban significantly  outweighs its minimal negative effects on the right of free expression, and by  extension, the principle of open and accessible court proceedings. The  affidavit did not play a role in determining that a wrongful conviction had  occurred. For these reasons, the Court upheld the publication ban. "
2023 SCC 26,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that mandatory minimum sentences for child luring are unconstitutional. </strong>Section 172.1(1) of the <em>Criminal Code </em>sets out the offence of child luring. This offence is  committed when an adult uses telecommunication to target a child, or a person  believed to be a child, for the purposes of committing another offence against  that child, such as sexual exploitation, sexual assault, incest and child  pornography. It is a hybrid offence, which means the Crown prosecutor can  choose to proceed by indictment (a more serious offence) or by summary  conviction (a less serious offence). The mandatory minimum sentence for child  luring is one year’s imprisonment if the offender is guilty on indictment and  six months’ imprisonment if the offender is guilty on summary conviction. In the first case, Maxime Bertrand Marchand pleaded  guilty to one count of sexual interference and one count of child luring. He  met the victim in person in 2013 when he was 22 and she was 13 years old. For  the following two years, they were in contact on social media, met in person  and had illegal sexual intercourse four separate times. At the sentencing stage  of the proceedings, Mr. Bertrand Marchand challenged the one-year mandatory  minimum period of incarceration for persons found guilty of the indictable  offence of child luring, claiming it was inconsistent with section 12 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  which protects against cruel and unusual punishment. The judge agreed with him,  finding that a one-year mandatory minimum sentence would be grossly  disproportionate to the sentence of five months’ incarceration she imposed for  luring to be served at the same time as his sentence for sexual interference. The  majority of the Court of Appeal upheld both the sentence and the conclusion  that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional. On appeal before the  Supreme Court of Canada, the Crown asked the Court to substitute Mr. Bertrand  Marchand’s five-month sentence with a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. It  also asked the Court to find the one-year mandatory minimum sentence  constitutional.  In an unrelated case, H.V., whose name cannot be  disclosed due to a publication ban protecting the victim, pleaded guilty to one  count of child luring after sending sexual text messages to the victim over a  period of 10 days in 2017. He challenged the six-month mandatory minimum  sentence of incarceration for child luring punishable on summary conviction on  the basis that it violated section 12 of the <em>Charter</em>. The Court of Québec judge agreed with him, and instead,  imposed a sentence of two years’ probation and 150 hours of community service.  On appeal, the Superior Court varied the sentence to four months’ imprisonment  and agreed that while the mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly  disproportionate to H.V.’s sentence, it would be when applied to other  reasonably foreseeable scenarios. The Court of Appeal upheld that decision. On  appeal to this Court, the Crown did not challenge H.V.’s sentence, but it asked  the Court to find the six-month mandatory minimum sentence is constitutional.The Supreme Court has allowed the Crown’s appeal in  part in Mr. Bertrand Marchand’s case and dismissed its appeal in the case of  H.V. <strong>The mandatory  minimum sentences are grossly disproportionate in a range of foreseeable  scenarios.   </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin agreed with the courts below in both cases that the  mandatory minimum sentences for luring a child set out in section 172.1(2)(a)  and (b) of the <em>Code </em>are inconsistent  with section 12 of the <em>Charter.</em> As  she explained, invalidating the mandatory minimums did not mean that child  luring was a less serious offence. In some cases, the appropriate penalty for  child luring will be imprisonment for a period equal to or longer than that  contained in the unconstitutional mandatory minimum sentences. That said,  Justice Martin emphasized “the mandatory periods of incarceration apply to such  an exceptionally wide scope of conduct that the result is grossly  disproportionate punishments in reasonably foreseeable scenarios”.  She dismissed both  appeals on this issue.   However, Justice Martin allowed the Crown’s appeal  with respect to the length of Mr. Bertrand Marchand’s sentence. In her view,  the first judge minimized the harm caused to the victim by failing to recognize  the grooming that occurred and underestimated Mr. Bertrand Marchand’s actions,  resulting in minimizing the wrongfulness and distinct harms of the luring  offence. For these reasons, Justice Martin increased the sentence from five  months’ to  one year’s imprisonment and said it should be served after rather than at the  same time as his sentence for sexual interference."
2023 SCC 25,"<strong>The Supreme Court  dismisses the appeal of two company presidents who breached their contractual duty  to act in good faith.</strong>In 2002, Antoine Ponce and Daniel Riopel became presidents of three Quebec companies in  the insurance industry that were grouped under the name “Groupe Excellence”. A “Presidents’  Agreement” to that effect was entered into by the presidents and the companies’  majority shareholders, Michel Rhéaume and André Beaulne. The  Agreement gave the presidents significant benefits, including incentive pay. It  also formalized a business relationship between the parties that was based on  their commitment to work toward the common goal of ensuring the success of Groupe  Excellence, even with a view to a potential sale.In 2005, while the Agreement was  still in force, the presidents learned that a third party, Industrial Alliance  Insurance and Financial Services Inc., was interested in acquiring the  companies. Rather than revealing this to the shareholders, the presidents  decided to buy the whole of the shareholders’ stakes themselves and then resell  them to the third party. This earned them a substantial profit.The shareholders blamed the  presidents for not disclosing the interest expressed by the third party in  acquiring the companies and, as a result, depriving them of that business  opportunity. They claimed that the presidents had breached their obligation to  perform the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of good faith. The  presidents answered that contractual loyalty did not require them to subordinate  their interests to those of the shareholders.In Quebec civil law, contractual  good faith is an implied obligation resulting from the combination of articles 1375  and 1434 of the <em>Civil Code of Québec </em>(<em>Code</em>). Article 1375 states that  “[t]he parties shall conduct themselves in good faith both at the time the  obligation arises and at the time it is performed or extinguished”. Article 1434  provides that a validly formed contract binds the parties “as to what they have  expressed in it but also as to what is incident to it according to its nature  and in conformity with usage, equity or law”.The Quebec Superior Court judge ruled  in the shareholders’ favour. He found that the presidents had used their roles  to obtain information for their own benefit. By doing so, they had breached the  duties of honesty and loyalty they owed to Groupe Excellence as company directors,  duties that could be extended to the shareholders because of the Agreement. The  judge ordered the presidents to pay the shareholders approximately $12 million,  an amount equal to the profits earned on the resale of the group to the third  party. The presidents appealed that  decision to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which confirmed the trial judge’s  conclusions. It specified, however, that the obligations breached by the  presidents, that is, the obligation to act in good faith and the obligation to  inform, were only contractual obligations arising from the Agreement. The  presidents appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. <strong>The presidents’ non-disclosure of the third party’s interest in  acquiring the group was wrongful.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Kasirer  ruled that the presidents’ failure to inform the shareholders of the third  party’s interest in acquiring the group was a breach of the requirements of  good faith. The presidents breached contractual loyalty linked to good faith,  which was an implied obligation under the contract through the combined effect  of articles 1434 and 1375 of the <em>Code</em>.  While the presidents did not have to subordinate their interests to those of  the shareholders, the requirements of good faith in the performance of the  Agreement included a duty for the presidents to inform the shareholders of the  third party’s interest.Justice Kasirer added that the  Agreement also involved an implied obligation to inform that required the  presidents to provide the shareholders with all information relevant to making  an informed decision about the sale of their shares. He specified that this implied  obligation flowed from the nature of the Agreement, which reflected the  presumed intention of the parties, in accordance with article 1474 of the<em> Code</em>. In short, the Agreement was  intended to “formalize a mutually beneficial business relationship between the [presidents]  and the shareholders”.Since the presidents did not show  any palpable error in the trial judge’s conclusion that the shareholders’ lost gain  was equivalent to the profits made by the presidents, Justice Kasirer did  not interfere with the assessment of the damages to be paid to the shareholders."
2023 SCC 24,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms a double  murder conviction. </strong><strong> </strong>This appeal is about the instructions given to the  jury on criminal liability in the case of Don Johnson, who was tried and later  convicted in the shooting deaths of two brothers, aged 18 and 22. They were  shot in the stairwell of a Toronto apartment complex in February 2012. There were no eyewitnesses to the murders, and no security  cameras in the stairwell where the shootings occurred. However, surveillance  footage captured Mr. Johnson, the two brothers, and a fourth man heading  towards the stairwell just prior to the shooting. Video also showed Mr. Johnson  and the fourth man running away from the stairwell a short while later. In the  absence of footage from within the stairwell, it is impossible to know who,  between Mr. Johnson and the fourth man, killed the two brothers. Mr. Johnson was the only one charged in the deaths. At  trial, the Crown’s theory was that Mr. Johnson murdered the first brother as  revenge for implicating him in a previous crime, and killed the second brother  in order to prevent him from avenging the first brother’s death. Before the  jury started its deliberations, however, the trial judge instructed it on two  possible ways they could find Mr. Johnson guilty under Section 21 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>: either as the “principal”  who shot the deceased, or as a party who “aided” the fourth person in  committing the crimes, a concept known as “party liability.” In terms of guilt,  there is no difference between being an aider or the principal to an offence,  as they are all equally culpable. The jury subsequently convicted Mr. Johnson  of two counts of first-degree murder. Mr. Johnson appealed his conviction to  the Court of Appeal for Ontario. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed his  appeal. It decided the trial judge had been correct to include the possibility  of Mr. Johnson’s party liability as an alternative basis for conviction because  there was an ‘air of reality’ to the evidence in support of finding that Mr.  Johnson helped in the murders. According to the majority’s review of the  evidence, Mr. Johnson had recruited the fourth person on the day of the  shooting, scoped out the location of the shooting in advance, and disposed of  his phone containing incriminating messages after the events.   One judge disagreed. He said there was no air of  reality to the suggestion that, if Mr. Johnson was not the shooter, he aided  the actual shooter during the murders. In his view, entertaining this  alternative basis for liability despite weak evidence created the risk that one  or more jurors who were not convinced Mr. Johnson was the shooter could still  have convicted him on the basis that he was present during the murders and  could have helped in the outcome. He would have allowed the appeal, set aside  Mr. Johnson’s conviction and ordered a new trial.  Mr. Johnson appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. <strong>The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.   </strong>This means Mr. Johnson’s  murder convictions are upheld and he will serve his sentence.

2023 SCC 23,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules  the federal impact assessment scheme is largely unconstitutional.</strong>In this case, the Supreme Court looked at the constitutionality of  the federal environmental assessment scheme under the <em>Impact Assessment Act</em>, enacted by Parliament in 2019. The Court was  asked to consider whether the Act and one of its regulations went beyond  Parliament’s legislative authority under the Constitution.The Act and the regulations establish a complex information  gathering and regulatory scheme in two parts. One part, which is set out in  sections 81 to 91 of the Act, establishes an impact assessment process for  projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or  outside Canada. It requires the federal authority, in such cases, to decide if  the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. If  so, it must then be determined whether these effects are justified in the  circumstances.<strong></strong>The other part, which includes the remaining provisions in the Act  and the regulations, outlines what projects are considered “designated  projects” under the Act and makes them subject to federal review automatically. <strong></strong>Alberta’s Lieutenant Governor referred two questions with respect to  this scheme to the province’s Court of Appeal — references are when governments  ask courts for their legal opinion on a question of law. First, they asked  whether the Act was unconstitutional, in whole or in part, as being beyond  Parliament’s legislative authority under the Constitution (the legal term for  this is <em>ultra vires</em>). Second, they  asked whether the regulations were unconstitutional, in whole or in part, because  they applied to matters entirely within the legislative authority of the  provinces under the Constitution. A majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal concluded  that the Act and the regulations were <em>ultra  vires</em> Parliament and therefore unconstitutional in their entirety.The Attorney General of Canada appealed this decision to the Supreme  Court. Unlike the federal government, which can direct reference questions  straight to the Supreme Court, provincial and territorial governments must  first direct reference questions to their courts of appeal. However, provincial  and territorial opinions can be appealed to the Supreme Court as-of-right (automatically),  which means they do not require leave (permission) to be heard by the Court.<strong> </strong>The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part.<strong> </strong><strong>Although the process set  forth in sections 81 to 91 of the Act is constitutional, the balance of the  scheme is <em>ultra vires</em> Parliament and  thus unconstitutional.</strong>Writing for a majority of the Court, Chief Justice Wagner ruled that  the reference questions should be answered in the affirmative: the federal  impact assessment scheme is unconstitutional in part. While the  constitutionality of sections 81 to 91 of the Act was not challenged, Chief  Justice Wagner said that the process set forth therein is constitutional.  However, the balance of the scheme — that is, the “designated projects” portion  — is <em>ultra vires</em> Parliament and thus  unconstitutional for two overarching reasons. First, it is not directed at  regulating “effects within federal jurisdiction” as defined in the Act, because  these effects do not drive the scheme’s decision-making functions. Second, the  defined term “effects within federal jurisdiction” does not align with federal  legislative jurisdiction. The overbreadth of these effects exacerbates the  constitutional frailties of the scheme’s decision-making functions, he said.As Chief Justice Wagner wrote, “[e]nvironmental protection remains  one of today’s most pressing challenges. To meet this challenge, Parliament has the power  to enact a scheme of environmental assessment. Parliament also has the duty,  however, to act within the enduring division of powers framework laid out in  the Constitution”. Moreover, the Chief Justice noted that “it is open to  Parliament and the provincial legislatures to exercise their respective powers  over the environment harmoniously, in the spirit of cooperative federalism”,  adding that “both levels of government can exercise leadership in environmental  protection and ensure the continued health of our shared environment.”<strong> </strong>"
2023 SCC 22,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  publication bans on matters heard before the juries were empanelled in two criminal  cases.</strong> Section 648(1) of the <em>Criminal Code </em>is an automatic ban prohibiting the publication or  broadcast of information about portions of a criminal trial at which the jury  is not present. At issue in this case is whether and, if so, how this automatic  ban applies before the jury is empanelled (meaning constituted), given section 645(5)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Section 645(5)  confers jurisdiction upon trial judges, since 1985, to deal with any matter  that would ordinarily or necessarily be dealt with in the jury’s absence before  it has been empanelled. The Supreme Court of Canada heard together two appeals  on this issue.In both cases, numerous matters were dealt with before  the empanelment of the jury, including requests to exclude some evidence from the  trial and stop the proceedings for abuse of process, as well as a  constitutional challenge. In the first case, Frédérick Silva was tried in the  Superior Court of Quebec on four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.  In an unrelated case, Aydin Coban was charged in British Columbia with several  offences relating to child pornography, extortion, child luring and harassment. Certain  media outlets applied for orders allowing the publication of information from  the hearings on those matters. The judges in both cases dismissed their applications,  concluding that s. 648(1) applies before the empanelment of the jury.  Information from those hearings could therefore not be published until the  juries retired for deliberations or were dismissed.The media outlets then asked to appeal directly to the  Supreme Court of Canada, relying on a case called <em><a href=""https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/1204/1/document.do"">Dagenais</a></em>.  In that case, the Supreme Court said a third party, like the media outlets, could  appeal a publication ban in a criminal proceeding directly to the Court under  section 40 of the <em>Supreme Court Act</em>. The Court granted the media outlets leave to appeal;  however, it ultimately dismissed their appeals. <strong>Section 648(1)  of the <em>Criminal Code </em>applies before  the jury is empanelled only to matters dealt with under section 645(5). </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Wagner ruled  that the automatic publication ban in section 648(1) applies not only after the  jury is empanelled, but also before it is empanelled with respect to matters dealt  with under section 645(5). As the Chief Justice explained, “this conclusion  follows from an understanding of the text of s. 648(1) when considered in its  full context and in light of Parliament’s purpose. This interpretation does not  expand the coverage of the publication ban: only matters that were captured by  the ban prior to the enactment of s. 645(5) continue to be captured by it  today.” In Mr. Silva’s case, the requests to stop the  proceedings and exclude certain evidence from trial had to be heard by the  trial judge. They could be heard before the jury was empanelled only by virtue  of the trial judge’s jurisdiction under section 645(5). It follows that they  were covered by the automatic publication ban. Likewise in Mr. Coban’s case,  the media had applied for a declaration that section 648(1) applies only after  the jury has been empanelled. Chief Justice Wagner concluded that the trial  judge’s dismissal of that request was consistent with the proper interpretation  of section 648(1). <strong>Court openness and trial fairness</strong>Chief Justice Wagner noted  that both the open court principle and trial fairness serve to instill public  confidence in the justice system. The public can understand the work of the  courts, and thus come to trust the judicial process and its outcomes, only if  informed of what a judge decides and why the particular decision is made. The  media play a crucial role in making this possible. The protection of fair trial  interests, such as the right to an independent, impartial and representative  jury, is also essential to public confidence in the administration of justice.  Publication bans like the one imposed by s. 648(1) are limitations on court  openness that protect the right of the accused to, and society’s interest in, a  fair trial.

2023 SCC 21,<strong>The Supreme Court quashes  immigration decisions that found two foreign nationals inadmissible to Canada.   <em>    </em></strong>
2023 SCC 20,"<strong>The Supreme Court dismisses a new  trial request for a man convicted of two murders.</strong>
   This is a case about determining  the proper role of <em>amicus curiae </em>in a  criminal trial. “<em>Amicus curiae</em>” (the  plural form is “<em>amici</em>”) is a Latin  term meaning “friend of the court.” The <em>amicus </em>is an independent lawyer asked by a judge to take part in a case. They do  not represent a party to the case. The precise role of the <em>amicus </em>is case-specific and will  depend on the particular needs identified by the judge. When the accused does  not have a lawyer, the judge may appoint an <em>amicus</em> to assist the court, for example by challenging the prosecution’s case and  cross-examining witnesses. The goal is to make sure the judge or jury hears an  “adversarial perspective” – an alternative to the prosecution’s version of the  case – to come to a fair outcome. Two <em>amici </em>were appointed at different times  in the trial of Mr. Emanuel Kahsai, who was convicted by a jury for murdering two  women in Calgary in 2015. The accused did not hire a lawyer to represent him at  trial – he insisted on representing himself for the entire proceedings. The  first <em>amicus </em>was appointed before  trial to help Mr. Kahsai with the jury selection process. At trial, Mr. Kahsai  was repeatedly disruptive. He did not question witnesses or present a defence. Partway  through the trial, the judge decided to name a second <em>amicus </em>to cross-examine the Crown’s witnesses and ensure the  proceedings were fair and appropriate. He was clear that the <em>amicus </em>would not act as the accused’s  defense lawyer, to respect Mr. Kahsai’s right to represent himself. Despite the  lawyer’s limited mandate, Mr. Kahsai resisted the appointment and mostly  refused to cooperate with him throughout the proceedings. At the end of  the trial, the judge cut short Mr. Kahsai’s closing argument because he was not  saying anything relevant to his defence. The judge did not ask the <em>amicus </em>to make closing arguments on  behalf of Mr. Kahsai. The <em>amicus </em>did  not ask permission to do so either  because he thought the scope of his role prevented him from arguing on behalf  of the defence. Mr. Kahsai  appealed his murder convictions to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. He argued the  trial judge’s failure to appoint the <em>amicus</em> earlier in the trial and with a more adversarial role created the appearance of  unfairness, which justified a new trial. Two of the three judges dismissed the  appeal. They said that appointing the <em>amicus</em> with adversarial functions would have violated Mr. Kahsai’s right to represent  himself. The third judge disagreed and wrote that imposing a lawyer on the  accused when the case was complex and the accused was incompetent to self-represent  did not infringe their right to control their own defence – rather, it  preserved their right to a fair trial. Mr. Kahsai appealed to this Court. The Supreme Court  has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The amicus’ delayed appointment and limited  role did not justify ordering a new trial.</strong>
     Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Karakatsanis said the trial appeared fair to a  reasonable observer, such that a new trial was not necessary. She said that while  the <em>amicus </em>can never fully assume the  role of the accused’s lawyer, they can take on “defence-like functions” when an  adversarial perspective is necessary to ensure trial fairness. In this case,  Justice Karakatsanis said the appointment of an <em>amicus</em> with a broader mandate was at the trial judge’s discretion but  that he was under no obligation to do so. She acknowledged the striking  imbalance at trial due to Mr. Kahsai’s lack of representation and meaningful  defence. However, “it is not clear that appointing <em>amicus</em> earlier or with a broader mandate would have provided much  value for Mr. Kahsai, who forcefully resisted the appointment of <em>amicus</em> and sustained his objection to  their participation throughout the trial”. In her view, the trial judge had  sufficiently addressed trial fairness concerns in the circumstances. For these  reasons, Justice Karakatsanis dismissed the appeal."
2023 SCC 19,"<strong>The Supreme Court orders a new trial  due to insufficient jury instructions.</strong> 
   Mr. Ahmed Abdullahi was arrested  in June 2013 as a result of an integrated police investigation into the  trafficking of illegal firearms in Toronto. A jury convicted him of various  firearm offences and one count of participation in the activities of a criminal  organization for the purpose of trafficking weapons, contrary to section 467.11  of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. This last  conviction was the only issue before the Supreme Court of Canada. Under section 467.11, the Crown  must first prove the existence of a “criminal organization”. The <em>Criminal Code </em>defines a criminal  organization as a group of three or more people, however organized, that  facilitates or commits a serious offence for a financial or other benefit.  Organized crimes attract greater police powers for certain authorizations and  warrants, and harsher sentences than those committed by groups that come  together randomly to commit a single offence. In its 2012 judgment in <em>R. v. Venneri</em>, the Supreme Court of  Canada said that for a criminal organization to be “organized”, it must have  “some form of structure and degree of continuity”. Before members of the jury  started their deliberations, the trial judge instructed them on the required  elements of the criminal organization offence, including the need to first  prove the existence of such an organization. On that element of the offence,  the judge read the definition of a criminal organization but did not mention  the need to identify a structure and a degree of continuity to qualify a group  as such. In the end, the jury found Mr. Abdullahi guilty on all counts,  including that of participating in the activities of a criminal organization  for the purpose of trafficking weapons. On appeal, Mr. Abdullahi argued  the judge’s instruction to the jury was insufficient because it failed to  explain that a criminal organization must have structure and continuity. The  majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the appeal and concluded  that the jury had been properly instructed. The dissenting judge disagreed and  would have ordered a new trial on that count. Mr. Abdullahi appealed the  conviction to this Court. The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal. <strong>The trial judge’s instruction did not sufficiently equip the jury to  decide if a criminal organization existed.</strong>
     Writing for the majority, Justice  Rowe first explained that the role of a court of appeal in reviewing a trial  judge’s jury instruction is to ensure the jury was properly equipped to decide  the case according to the law and the evidence. To equip a jury properly, it  needs an accurate and a sufficient understanding of the law. In this case, the trial judge  failed to explain to the jury that a criminal organization is one that by  virtue of its structure and continuity poses an enhanced threat to society. Institutional  advantages such as consolidating and retaining knowledge, sharing customers and  resources, developing specializations, and fostering trust and loyalty  distinguish criminal organizations from other groups of individuals acting in  concert, where they lack structure and continuity, and do not pose the same  enhanced threat to society. Moreover, careful consideration of a group’s  structure and continuity is needed to guard against improper reasoning based on  shared characteristics, such as ethnicity or neighbourhood, in identifying a  criminal organization. As Justice Rowe said, “[w]hile such characteristics may  indicate a common social or cultural identity among persons who commit  offences, they are irrelevant in identifying the existence of a criminal  organization”. Without such an explanation at  trial, Justice Rowe concluded the jury was not sufficiently instructed on the  legal standard to apply to the evidence in concluding that a criminal  organization existed. For these reasons, he allowed the appeal, set aside the  appellant’s conviction for participation in the activities of a criminal  organization, and ordered a new trial on that count."
2023 SCC 18,"<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that an offender who was prohibited from driving for 21  months while waiting to be sentenced had already served the mandatory minimum  punishment.</strong>
     On the night of  October 7, 2017, Ms. Basque was stopped in downtown Moncton, New Brunswick,  for driving her vehicle erratically. She was charged with impaired driving and  released on November 30 of the same year on the condition that she not drive a  motor vehicle while awaiting trial. She eventually pleaded guilty. It was her  first offence in 10 years, so it was treated as a first offence. Between her initial  appearance and the date she was sentenced, 21 months passed. Under section 259(1)(a)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> (now  section 320.24(2)(a)), a first offence is punishable by an order prohibiting  the offender from driving a motor vehicle for a minimum of one year. Furthermore,  section 719(1) of the <em>Code</em> states  that, except where otherwise provided, a sentence commences when it is imposed.  However, there is also a rule under the common law — the body of law that is not  written down as legislation but is instead based on precedent — that gives  judges a discretion to grant credit for the time an offender has spent subject  to a driving prohibition before being sentenced, that is, a “pre‑sentence  prohibition”. The interaction between these <em>Code</em> provisions and the common law rule is at the heart of this appeal. The Provincial Court  judge imposed a $1,000 fine and a one‑year driving prohibition on  Ms. Basque, in accordance with section 259(1)(a). He then considered  the 21 months she had already been prohibited from driving and credited them  against her sentence. He also backdated the order to November 30, 2017, the  first day of the pre‑sentence prohibition, which meant that Ms. Basque had  already served the entire sentence by the date of the judge’s decision and was  not subject to any further driving prohibition. The Crown appealed that  judgment. The Court of Queen’s Bench appeal judge sided with the first judge. On appeal to the New  Brunswick Court of Appeal, a majority of the judges allowed the appeal, stating  that the law does not allow such credit to be granted if this results in a  prohibition being imposed for less than the minimum period required. It  varied the appeal judge’s decision to include a new one‑year driving  prohibition. Ms. Basque then appealed  that decision to the Supreme Court. The Court has allowed the appeal. <strong>Ms. Basque could be credited for the driving  prohibition period she had already served, notwithstanding the one‑year  mandatory minimum provided for in the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.</strong>
     Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Kasirer stated that granting credit based on the  common law discretion is perfectly consistent with the application of sections 259(1)(a)  and 719(1). He explained that this coexistence rests on the well‑known  distinction between the concepts of “punishment”, which refers to the total  punishment imposed on an offender, and “sentence”, which refers to the decision  rendered by the court and which commences the day it is handed down by that court. Justice Kasirer determined  that section 259(1)(a) requires the court to impose a total punishment of  one year to be served, not to hand down a sentence imposing a one‑year prohibition  that must be served prospectively. This interpretation is in keeping with the objectives of deterrence and  punishment that underlie the provision. As he explained, “Parliament’s intention is respected whether the  punishment is served before or after the offender is sentenced, because the  effect on the offender is the same in either case”. The sentencing judge was  therefore correct in granting credit for the pre‑sentence prohibition, but his  decision to backdate the sentence was an error. According to Justice Kasirer, the  judge could have imposed the one‑year mandatory minimum driving prohibition on  Ms. Basque, stated that a sentence commences when it is imposed, and then  granted credit for the pre‑sentence prohibition period she had already served. In  her case, because that period exceeded the one‑year minimum, the objectives of  the minimum punishment were already met, and even surpassed. For these reasons,  Justice Kasirer concluded that no further prohibition was required."
2023 SCC 17,"<strong>The Supreme Court holds the  regulations designating the United States as a safe third country do not  infringe refugee claimants’ rights to liberty and security of the person.</strong> 
   In 2002, Canada and the United States concluded a bilateral treaty  known as the “<em>Safe Third Country  Agreement</em>” (STCA). As a general rule under the STCA, refugee claimants must  seek protection in whichever of the two countries they first enter after  leaving their country of origin. This rule is incorporated in section 101(1)(e)  of Canada’s <em>Immigration and Refugee  Protection Act </em>(the Act) and section 159.3 of the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations </em>(the Regulation). While there are some exceptions, someone is ineligible under the Act to  claim refugee status in Canada if they arrive at a land port of entry from a  “safe third country”. This designation is based on criteria including the  country’s compliance with the principle of “<em>non-refoulement</em>”.  The principle – which is the  cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime – prohibits  returning a person to a place where they would face torture, cruel or degrading  treatment, or threats to their life or freedom. A “safe third country” is thus  seen as an appropriate partner with which the responsibility for considering  refugee claims can be shared. Section 159.3 of the Regulation designates the  United States as such. The appellants in this case are individual refugee claimants and public  interest litigants advocating on their behalf. The refugee claimants all  arrived in Canada in 2017 from the United States. They feared gender-based  persecution and sexual violence committed by gangs or oppression in their  countries of origin. Because they arrived at land ports of entry from the U.S.,  they were ineligible to claim refugee protection in Canada. The refugee claimants argued the Regulation designating the U.S. as a  safe third country violates the rights guaranteed under section 7 of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> because it  results in Canadian immigration officers returning refugees to the United  States without considering whether that country will respect their rights under  international law, including those relating to <em>non-refoulement </em>and detention. They also allege the Regulation  violates the <em>Charter </em>guarantee of equality under section 15 because women  facing gender-based persecution are often denied refugee status in the United  States and face the risk of <em>refoulement</em>. In 2020, a Federal Court judge found the Regulation violated section 7  of the <em>Charter</em>. Based on her review  of the evidence, the liberty and security of the person were threatened given  therisks of <em>refoulement</em>, detention and the conditions of detention faced by refugee  claimants who were returned to the United States. The Minister of Citizenship  and Immigration and the Minister  of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness appealed. The Federal Court  of Appeal set aside the judgment. In its view, the <em>Charter </em>challenge should not have focused on the Regulation itself.  Rather, it should have targeted Canada’s action or inaction in the continuing review  of the United States’ designation as a “safe third country”. Neither court  ruled on the section 15 claim. The refugee claimants then brought the case to  this Court. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part. <strong>Under Canadian law, refugee  claimants may be exempted from return to the United States if their section 7 <em>Charter </em>rights are at risk.</strong>
     Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Kasirer said the Regulation  designating the United States as a safe third country for the purposes of the  STCA does not breach section 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. He agreed with some of the Federal  Court judge’s findings relating to the treatment of refugee claimants in the  United States, namely the risk of detention upon being returned there and some aspects  of detention conditions. He also proceeded on the assumption that a risk of <em>refoulement </em>flowed from some of the  United States’ policies. As such, he concluded the designation of the United  States engages interests of liberty and security of the person set out in section  7. However, the legislative scheme could stand because it contained ways  for Canada to consider refugee status claims when ineligibility under the  scheme would lead to deprivations of liberty or security of the person. These  legislative “safety valves” include for example discretionary exemptions on the  basis of humanitarian and compassionate or public policy grounds. They ensure  compliance with the principles of fundamental justice. As Justice Kasirer put  it, “when the [Act]’s safety valves are activated, claimants can be exempted  from return”.  He added that it may well be that, in  practice, administrative decision makers do not always construe or deploy the  legislative safety valves appropriately. In such cases, the legislation itself  remains valid, but administrative and <em>Charter </em>relief remains available on an individual basis. Yet this is not what the Court  had been asked to provide here. As a result, Justice Kasirer dismissed the appeal on the section 7  claim and returned the appellants’ section 15 claim to the Federal Court for  determination, given the lack of factual findings on which the Supreme Court could  rely, the complexity of the record and conflicting evidence, and the profound  seriousness of the matter."
2023 SCC 16,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds a decision  by the Minister of National Revenue to deny tax deductions to a British  Columbia-based company that engaged in abusive tax avoidance.</strong> <em></em>
   In 2007, Forbes Medi-Tech Inc. (now  Deans Knight Income Corporation) was a British Columbia-based drug research and  nutritional food additive business in financial difficulty. It had accumulated  approximately $90 million of unclaimed non-capital losses and other tax  credits. Non-capital losses are financial losses resulting from carrying on a  business that spends more than it makes in a given year. Under the <em>Income Tax Act </em>(the Act), a taxpayer can  reduce their income tax by deducting non-capital losses from its taxable income.  If the taxpayer does not use all, or a portion, of the loss in the year it  incurred it, they may carry the loss back three years, or forward 20 years.  However, under section 111(5) of the Act, when another entity acquires control  of the company, the new owners may not carry over those non-capital losses and  deduct them from its future taxes, unless the company continues to operate the  same or a similar business. Deans Knight wanted to use its  non-capital losses but did not have sufficient income against which to offset them.  In early 2008, it entered into a complex investment agreement with venture  capital firm Matco Capital Ltd, to help it become profitable. The agreement was  drafted in a way that ensured Matco did not acquire control of Deans Knight by  becoming the majority shareholder because that would trigger the restriction on  carrying over losses under section 111(5) of the Act. However, in effect, Matco  gained considerable influence over Deans Knight’s business affairs. It found a  separate mutual fund management company that would use Deans Knight as a  corporate vehicle to raise money through an initial public offering. That money  would then be used to transform Deans Knight into an investment business. This  was attractive to Deans Knight because it could make use of its non-capital  losses to shelter most of the new business’ portfolio income and capital gains. The business plan was successful.  When Deans Knight filed its tax returns for 2009 to 2012, it claimed nearly $65  million in non-capital losses and other tax credits, thereby reducing its tax  liability. However, the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) reassessed  Deans Knight’s tax returns and denied the deductions. The company appealed that  decision to the Tax Court of Canada. The Tax Court found that Deans  Knight gained a tax benefit through a series of transactions that it concluded  primarily for tax avoidance purposes, but that the transactions did not amount  to an abuse of the Act, namely section 111(5). The Minister appealed to the  Federal Court of Appeal, which held that the transactions were abusive. It  applied the “general anti-avoidance rule” (GAAR) under the Act to deny Deans Knight’s  tax deductions. The GAAR operates to deny tax benefits flowing from  transactions that comply with the literal text of the Act, but that  nevertheless constitute abusive tax avoidance. Deans Knight appealed to this  Court. The Supreme Court  has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The transactions went against the rationale  of section 111(5) of the Income Tax Act and amounted to abusive tax avoidance.</strong>
     Writing for  the majority, Justice Rowe decided the transactions were abusive and the GAAR  applied to deny Deans Knight’s tax benefits. Despite complying with the literal  text of a provision in the Act, a transaction is abusive if it frustrates its  rationale. Justice Rowe said the rationale behind section 111(5) of the Act is  to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to  deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit  of new shareholders. Deans Knight  was fundamentally transformed through a series of transactions that achieved  the outcome that the Act sought to prevent, while narrowly circumventing the  restriction in section 111(5). Matco did not acquire control of Deans Knight  through majority voting shares but achieved its functional equivalent and  fundamentally changed the company’s business. As Justice Rowe explained, “the  appellant was gutted of any vestiges from its prior corporate ‘life’ and became  an empty vessel with [unused deductions]”. He concluded the results of the  transactions clearly frustrated the rationale of section 111(5) and therefore  constituted abuse. For these reasons, he restored the Minister’s reassessment  denying the tax deductions."
2023 SCC 14,"<strong>The Supreme Court restores a B.C.  court’s dismissal of a defamation suit.</strong>
   This case  focuses on a defamation lawsuit after a public debate around an initiative to equip  educators with resources to teach students about sexual orientation and gender  identity. In 2016, British Columbia’s Ministry of Education launched “Sexual  Orientation and Gender Identity 123” (SOGI 123). The aim of SOGI 123 is to  foster inclusion and respect for students who may face discrimination in school  because of their gender identity or expression. Mr. Barry Neufeld, an elected  public school board trustee in Chilliwack, B.C., publicly criticized the  initiative in online posts, which triggered significant controversy including  calls for him to resign. Many people in the community considered his statements  derogatory of transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals. Mr. Glen Hansman, a  gay man, teacher and former president of the British Columbia Teachers’  Federation, publicly denounced Mr. Neufeld’s views, including to the news  media, calling them bigoted, transphobic and hateful. He accused him of  undermining safety and inclusivity for transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ students in  schools, and questioned whether he should remain a school board trustee. Mr. Neufeld  sued Mr. Hansman for defamation. In response, Mr. Hansman asked the court to  dismiss the lawsuit under the province’s<em> Protection  of Public Participation Act</em> (the Act). He argued that Mr. Neufeld had  launched a “strategic lawsuit against public participation” (SLAPP). Rather  than compensating the plaintiff for serious harm to their reputation, the goal  of this kind of legal action is to silence the defendant and suppress debate on  matters of public interest. The Act aims to counter SLAPPs. When a court determines that protecting free  debate on matters of public interest outweighs harm to the plaintiff, section 4  of the Act instructs it to  dismiss this type of lawsuit. The first  instance judge dismissed Mr. Neufeld’s defamation lawsuit, finding that it had  the effect of suppressing debate on matters of public interest. He determined  the value in protecting Mr. Hansman’s expression outweighed the harm Mr.  Neufeld likely suffered. The Court of Appeal disagreed and allowed the  defamation suit to continue. Mr. Hansman appealed to this Court. The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal. <strong>The first instance judge correctly  dismissed Mr. Neufeld’s defamation suit.</strong>
     Writing for  the majority, Justice Karakatsanis restored the first judge’s order dismissing  Mr. Neufeld’s defamation suit. She decided the public interest in protecting  Mr. Hansman’s speech outweighed the public interest in remedying the  reputational harm to Mr. Neufeld. She agreed with the judge that Mr. Neufeld  had suffered limited harm, as he continued to express his views despite the  public reaction and won re-election a year later. As for Mr.  Hansman, he spoke out to counter what he and others perceived to be discriminatory  and harmful speech against transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ youth, “groups  especially vulnerable to expression that reduces their worth and dignity in the  eyes of society and questions their very identity”. His response to Mr.  Neufeld’s statements was neither disproportionate nor gratuitous. As Justice  Karakatsanis explained, “[t]he closer the expression lies to the core values of  [freedom of expression], including truth-seeking, participating in political  decision-making and diversity in the forms of self-fulfillment and human  flourishing, ‘the greater the public interest in protecting it’”. She concluded  Mr. Hansman’s speech aligned with these values."
2023 SCC 13,"<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies when  courts must consider certain domestic agreements in dividing family property  under Saskatchewan’s legislation.</strong> <em></em>
     The Andersons  were married in Saskatchewan for three years and separated in 2015. Ms.  Anderson prepared an agreement that stated each of them would keep their own  property and give up their rights to the other’s property except for the family  home and household goods, which they owned jointly. Both parties signed the  agreement before two of their friends who acted as witnesses. Neither party benefited  from independent legal advice before signing the agreement. Ms. Anderson later  filed for divorce. Mr. Anderson counter-filed to ask the court to divide the  family property, arguing that the agreement was signed without legal advice and  under duress.Like other  provincial family property laws, <em>The  Family Property Act</em> (<em>FPA</em>) of  Saskatchewan provides that family property will be distributed equally unless spouses  agree otherwise through an interspousal or other domestic contract.  Interspousal contracts are presumed binding if they meet certain requirements  under the <em>FPA</em>, such as a formal  acknowledgement by the parties that they understand the nature and the effect  of their agreement in the presence of different lawyers. According to the <em>FPA</em>, domestic contracts that do not meet  these formalities may still be considered by a court and given “whatever weight  it considers reasonable”. Since no lawyers were involved in the Andersons’  agreement, it did not qualify as an interspousal contract. At trial, the  judge found the agreement was not binding, partly because the Andersons had not  received legal advice before signing the domestic contract. As a result, he did  not give it any weight in crafting his property division order. The judge divided  the value of the couple’s assets equally under the <em>FPA</em> and ordered the wife to pay the husband a difference of around $90,000.  Ms. Anderson then took the case to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, which set  aside the trial judge’s order. Relying on an earlier judgment of the Supreme  Court of Canada (<em>Miglin v. Miglin</em>),  which created a framework to consider agreements for spousal support under the  federal <em>Divorce Act</em>, the Court of  Appeal found that the couple’s original agreement was binding and therefore  that it should have been considered in dividing the family property. It ordered  Mr. Anderson to pay Ms. Anderson around $5,000, using the trial judge’s  property valuation at the date closest in time to the agreement. Mr. Anderson appealed  to this Court. The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal. <strong>The  Andersons’ agreement was binding and the trial judge should have considered it  when dividing the family property.</strong>
    Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Karakatsanis gave effect to the Andersons’ agreement.  She said the agreement was short, uncomplicated and reflected the intention of  the parties to effect a clean break from their partnership. Moreover, Mr.  Anderson could not point to any prejudice resulting from the lack of  independent legal advice.  She disagreed  with the Court of Appeal’s reliance on <em>Miglin</em>,  noting that the judge’s interpretive exercise is statute-specific. However, she  arrived at the same conclusion that the trial judge should have given the  agreement serious consideration. Justice  Karakatsanis said domestic contracts should generally be encouraged and  supported by courts, within the bounds of the law, absent a compelling reason to  discount them. Deference to such agreements flows from the recognition that  self-sufficiency, autonomy and finality are important objectives in the family  law context. Moreover, “courts must review domestic contracts with particular  sensitivity to the vulnerabilities that can arise in the family law context,  without presuming that spouses lack the agency to contract simply because the  agreement was negotiated in an emotionally stressful context”.The Court  allowed the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal’s decision and enforced the  agreement. It divided the family home and household goods equally as of the  date of the trial, ordering Ms. Anderson to pay Mr. Anderson a difference of  approximately $43,000. "
2023 SCC 12,"<strong>The Supreme Court sets aside  convictions of manslaughter and other firearm offences due to unreasonable  trial delays.</strong> <em></em>
     On December 24, 2015, Mr. Dia ‘Eddin Hanan was  charged with crimes relating to the shooting of two men in the driveway of his  home. He was scheduled to be tried by jury in Windsor, Ontario in November 2018.  However, on the night before the trial, Crown counsel  announced that its only eyewitness refused to testify. It also disclosed new  evidence. This change risked suspending the proceedings. To avoid delay,  the accused offered to proceed to a trial by judge alone, without a jury. The Crown  refused. The judge proposed to reschedule the trial to June 2019, but counsel  for the accused was not available. The trial was ultimately postponed to the  end of October 2019, nearly a year later than its original start date. Due to  the delay, Mr. Hanan asked the judge to stop the trial, claiming that his right  to be tried within a reasonable time under section 11(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>had  been violated. This type of request is known as a stay of proceedings based on  unreasonable delay. A stay results in the end of the trial without an acquittal  or a finding of guilt.In an earlier unrelated judgment (<em>R. v. Jordan</em>),  the Supreme Court established a presumption that an accused’s right to be tried  within a reasonable time under section 11(b) of the <em>Charter </em>is violated if the time between charging the accused and  the end of the trial in a superior court exceeds the 30-month ceiling. Cases in  which charges were brought before <em>Jordan</em> are also subject to this new framework. However, a “transitional exceptional  circumstance” may apply if the Crown convinces the court that the parties were justified  in relying on the law as it stood prior to <em>Jordan</em>.  The exception accounts for the fact that the parties’ behaviour cannot be  judged strictly against the new ceiling in <em>Jordan</em> for which they had no notice. Since Mr. Hanan was charged before <em>Jordan </em>was decided in 2016, his case  fell into this category of transitional cases.The trial judge dismissed Mr. Hanan’s request for a  stay of proceedings. He determined that a total of 47.5 months had elapsed  between the day the accused was charged and the end of his trial. He deducted  some delay attributable to the defense, concluding that the net delay stood at around  35 months. He ruled that although the net delay exceeded the 30-month ceiling  established in <em>Jordan</em>, it was  justified because the parties had reasonably relied on the law before that case  was decided.Mr. Hanan was ultimately tried and convicted by  jury of manslaughter and other firearm charges. He appealed to the Ontario Court  of Appeal, where two of the three justices dismissed his arguments and affirmed  the convictions. The accused appealed as of right to this Court. An appeal “as  of right” is available in some criminal cases where one judge on the court of  appeal has dissented on a point of law, as was the case here. This means the  appellant does not need to apply to the Supreme Court of Canada for permission  to have their case heard. The case can be heard if the appellant simply files a  notice to this effect.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal. The  judgment was delivered orally by Justice Côté on the day of the hearing, with  written reasons to follow.<strong>The delay  was unreasonable and no transitional exceptional circumstance applied.</strong>In their reasons, Justices Côté and Rowe, who were  writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that the trial judge made a mistake in deciding  a transitional exceptional circumstance applied in this case. The delay of 35  months was unreasonable and contrary to section 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. They concluded the parties did  not actually rely on the pre-<em>Jordan</em> state of the law because they had consciously scheduled the original trial  within the 30-month ceiling as required by <em>Jordan</em>.Moreover, the parties had ample time to adapt to  the <em>Jordan </em>framework. The delay was  due to the Crown’s refusal to agree to a trial by judge alone, despite being  warned of the possible consequences of delay, and despite <em>Jordan</em> having been decided almost two and a half years earlier. As  the justices stated, “[w]ere it not for the Crown’s decision, the trial would  have occurred within the ceiling”.Justices Côté and Rowe concluded  that no transitional circumstance applied and the almost 35 month delay was  therefore unreasonable and contrary to section 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. They allowed the appeal, set  aside the convictions and ordered a stay of proceedings<strong>.</strong>
"
2023 SCC 11,"<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies that applications in criminal  proceedings must be “manifestly frivolous” to be summarily dismissed.</strong>Mr. Cody Rae  Haevischer and Mr. Matthew James Johnston were members of a criminal  organization called the Red Scorpions. In 2014, they were tried together and  found guilty of six counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy  to commit murder in what became known as the “Surrey Six” murders, precipitated  by a dispute over the drug trade in Surrey, British Columbia. Before  convictions were entered into the court record, the two accused asked the judge  to stop the trial. This is known as an application for a “stay of proceedings”.  In the criminal context, a stay is a remedy available to the accused when the  state has compromised their rights to a fair trial and undermined the integrity  of the justice system. Mr. Haevischer and Mr. Johnston each applied for a stay,  alleging systemic police misconduct by officers involved in the investigation. They  also claimed they were deliberately and punitively kept in solitary confinement  in harsh and inhumane conditions following their arrests. The Crown asked  the trial court to dismiss the stay applications, without considering them at a  full hearing on their merits. It argued that neither application disclosed sufficient  grounds to establish that a full hearing was necessary to determine whether the  alleged abuses entitled the accused to a stay of proceedings. The trial judge  agreed to hear the Crown’s request. She permitted Mr. Haevischer and Mr.  Johnston to present their arguments and some evidence, but the record did not  represent the full range of evidence they wanted the judge to consider. Such  evidence would have been submitted at a full hearing and would have included  cross-examinations of certain police officers involved in the misconduct. The trial  judge summarily dismissed the stay applications and ordered convictions. She concluded  that even if she believed everything the two men claimed, and even though the alleged  police misconduct was very serious, the crimes were so shocking that a stay of  proceedings would not be an appropriate remedy. In her view, there was no  reason to further consider the applications in a full hearing to hear all of  the accused’s evidence. The Court of Appeal allowed the  appeal. It held the trial judge had not  taken the correct approach in coming to her decision. She had not assumed that all  of the allegations were true. In fact, if all of Mr. Haevischer and Mr.  Johnston’s allegations were believed to be true, there was some chance the  trial could be stayed. As a result, it was necessary to hear all of the  accused’s evidence to determine the applications. The Crown appealed to the  Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The trial judge should not have summarily dismissed the applications as  they were not manifestly frivolous.</strong>
    Writing for a unanimous Court,  Justice Martin ruled that an application in a criminal proceeding should only  be summarily dismissed if the application is “manifestly frivolous”. She  explained that when applied, the “frivolous” part of this standard weeds out  the applications that will necessarily fail, while the word “manifestly”  captures the notion that the frivolous nature of the application should be  obvious. According to Justice Martin, “[i]f the frivolous nature of the  application is not manifest or obvious on the face of the record, then the  application should not be summarily dismissed and should instead be addressed  on its merits”. By adopting this rigorous standard, a judge may dismiss  applications that would never succeed and which would, by definition, waste  court time. However, it also protects fair trial rights by ensuring that those  applications which might succeed are decided on their merits.In  light of the seriousness of the alleged state misconduct in this case, Justice  Martin concluded the applications were not manifestly frivolous and should not  have been dismissed summarily. She dismissed the appeal but ordered the trial  court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Mr. Haevischer’s application for a  stay of proceedings only, as Mr. Johnston had died after the appeal was argued  before the Supreme Court of Canada."
2023 SCC 10,"<strong>The  Supreme Court of Canada rules that Quebec’s ban on possessing and cultivating  cannabis plants for personal purposes is constitutional. </strong>In 2018, the federal  government enacted a law about cannabis, which says people cannot possess or cultivate  more than four cannabis plants at home. Provinces and territories then enacted  their own laws to regulate practical matters, such as how cannabis can be sold  and stored. In Quebec, the <em>Cannabis  Regulation Act</em> prohibits the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants  for personal purposes. If caught breaking this law, people can be fined between  $250 and $750. Soon thereafter, Mr. Murray‑Hall  brought a case to Quebec’s Superior Court on his own behalf and on behalf of  everyone in that province who might be fined for possessing or cultivating  cannabis plants. He argued that the Quebec government does not have the power  to ban cannabis plants. He said that only the federal government has that power  as a matter of criminal law, which is within federal jurisdiction under section  91(27) of Canada’s Constitution. Alternatively, Mr. Murray‑Hall argued that  the Quebec ban should be declared of no force or effect because the federal law  should prevail over the provincial law. The judge agreed and  declared the Quebec ban unconstitutional. The Attorney General of Quebec  appealed that decision on behalf of the province.The Quebec Court of  Appeal disagreed and ruled that the ban is constitutional because it pertains  to matters of provincial jurisdiction under two other sections of the  Constitution: section 92(13), which allows provinces to make laws related to  property and civil rights; and section 92(16), which permits them to make laws  of a local or private nature within a province. That outcome meant Quebeckers  could not possess or cultivate cannabis plants. Mr. Murray‑Hall appealed  the decision to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.<strong>In pursuing public health and security  objectives, the Quebec legislature has jurisdiction to prohibit the possession  and cultivation of cannabis for personal purposes.</strong>Writing for a  unanimous Court, Chief Justice Wagner found that the pith and substance of the challenged  provisions of the provincial law is to ensure the effectiveness of the state  monopoly over cannabis in order to protect the health and security of the  public, and of young persons in particular, from cannabis harm. Banning the  possession of cannabis plants and their cultivation at home is a means of  achieving the provincial law’s public health and security objectives. According  to the Chief Justice, the prohibitions act as incentives for the  integration of consumers into the legal cannabis market that ensures “control  of the quality of the products offered, education on the risks of cannabis  consumption and compliance with rules on the minimum age for purchasing  cannabis”, among other things. Such provincial legislative action in the field  of public health comes within the provinces’ jurisdiction over property and  civil rights and residual jurisdiction over matters of a merely local or  private nature.The Chief Justice also  determined that the challenged provisions of the provincial law do not  frustrate the purpose of the federal law. Contrary to Mr. Murray‑Hall’s  argument that the purpose of the federal law is to confer a positive right to  possess or cultivate a maximum of four cannabis plants in order to eliminate or  reduce the illicit cannabis market, the Chief Justice stated that the purpose  of the federal law is rather to reduce the presence of criminal organizations  in the cannabis market while at the same time excluding  the possession and  cultivation of a maximum of four cannabis plants from the scope of the criminal  offences in that law. Although the provincial law  prohibits any possession or cultivation of cannabis plants, the same objective  guided both levels of  government.For these reasons, the  Chief Justice concluded that the provisions of the provincial law banning the possession  and cultivation of cannabis plants in Quebec are valid and operative under  Canada’s Constitution."
2023 SCC 9,"<strong>The  Supreme Court of Canada rules that police must have an approved screening  device with them when they order someone to provide a breath sample. </strong>Early in the afternoon  of April 2, 2017, in Val‑Bélair near Quebec City, police were looking for  someone reported by trail patrollers to be driving an all‑terrain vehicle (ATV)  while drunk. They stopped Pascal Breault, who was walking away from a parked  ATV at a campsite. The officers wanted to take a breath sample from Mr. Breault,  but they did not have an approved screening device (ASD) to do so. They radioed  nearby officers to obtain a device. While still waiting  for the device, the officers demanded that Mr. Breault provide a breath  sample. Mr. Breault refused three times to provide the required sample,  even after he was told that refusing without a reasonable excuse to comply with  the demand was a criminal offence. Given the repeated refusals of Mr. Breault,  who said he had not driven the <abbr title=""all‑terrain vehicle"">ATV</abbr>, and given that the device had not yet  arrived, the officers eventually cancelled their request. Mr. Breault was  then charged with refusing to comply with a demand by police to provide a  breath sample.Under section 254(2)(b)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> (now section 320.27(1)(b)),  police can demand that a person “provide forthwith” a breath sample if the  person is suspected of drinking and driving within the last three hours. The  test must be done using an <abbr title=""approved screening device"">ASD</abbr>. When a person blows into the device, it  provides officers with a reading that determines if there is sufficient alcohol  in the person’s body to warrant a full breathalyzer test. Anyone who refuses to  take the test without a reasonable excuse commits a criminal offence. A municipal court in  Quebec found Mr. Breault guilty of refusing to comply with a demand to  provide a breath sample, and Quebec’s Superior Court dismissed his appeal. He  then turned to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which allowed his appeal and  acquitted him. The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. <strong>The demand by police to provide a breath sample  was invalid because they did not have immediate access to an <abbr title=""approved screening device"">ASD</abbr> when making  the demand. </strong>Writing for a unanimous  Court, Justice Suzanne Côté ruled that the validity of a demand to provide a  breath sample requires that police have immediate access to an <abbr title=""approved screening device"">ASD</abbr> at the time  the demand is made. According to Justice Côté, the word “forthwith” in section 254(2)(b)  must, as a general rule, be given a strict interpretation that reflects its  ordinary meaning, namely “immediately” or “without delay”. At this step of the  detection procedure, a detained driver does not have a right to counsel as guaranteed  by section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms</em>, since the driver must provide a breath sample immediately.  The limit on this right is justified because the detention is very brief. It is  therefore essential to the constitutional validity of this provision that the  interpretation given to the word “forthwith” be consistent with its ordinary  meaning. As she noted, “[t]he more flexibly the word ‘forthwith’ is interpreted, the less the  recognized justification for limiting the right to counsel holds up”. Justice Côté stated  that, exceptionally, unusual circumstances may justify a flexible  interpretation of the word “forthwith” if they are related to the use of the  device or the reliability of the result. However, unusual circumstances cannot arise  from budgetary considerations or considerations of practical efficiency, such  as the supplying of <abbr title=""approved screening device"">ASD</abbr>s to police forces or the time needed to train officers  to use them. The absence of a device at the scene at the time the demand is made is  not in itself an unusual circumstance.The Crown did not show  that there were unusual circumstances that would account for the absence of an <abbr title=""approved screening device"">ASD</abbr> at the scene and thus justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy  requirement. Justice Côté therefore found that the demand made by police was  invalid. For these reasons, Mr. Breault’s refusal to provide a breath  sample was not a criminal offence."
2023 SCC 8,"<strong>The Supreme Court has restored the conviction of an Ontario man after  determining that evidence obtained from an unlawful sobriety stop was  nonetheless admissible. </strong>In the early morning of March 26, 2016, Ontario  Provincial Police officers spotted Walker McColman driving an all-terrain  vehicle (ATV) out of a convenience store parking lot onto a highway. The  officers were on general patrol in a small town on Lake Huron in Ontario and  decided to follow the ATV. They caught up to Mr. McColman about a minute later,  when he had pulled onto the private driveway of his parents’ home. The officers  approached Mr. McColman in the driveway and observed obvious signs of  impairment. They said Mr. McColman was unable to stand up straight and he  smelled strongly of alcohol. Mr. McColman told the officers that he might have  had 10 beers that evening. The officers arrested him for impaired driving and  brought him to the police station, where he did two breathalyzer tests. Mr.  McColman was then charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle  with a blood alcohol concentration above the legal limit.  At trial, one of the officers testified they  did not see any signs of impairment before stopping Mr. McColman. He explained  they were exercising their authority to conduct random sobriety checks under  section 48(1) of Ontario’s <em>Highway  Traffic Act</em> (HTA). This section gives the police the authority to randomly  stop a motor vehicle and check if the driver is sober. The Ontario Court of  Justice convicted Mr. McColman of driving with excess blood alcohol, imposed a  $1,000 fine, and prohibited him from driving for one year. Mr. McColman appealed. He argued the sobriety  stop was illegal under section 48(1) of the HTA because it was conducted on  private property. He also said the officers had breached his rights under  section 9 of the <em>Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms </em>to not be arbitrarily detained. As a result, Mr.  McColman argued the evidence obtained during the stop should have been excluded  from the trial pursuant to section 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. Section  24(2) requires that evidence obtained in a way that breached the <em>Charter</em> rights of an accused be excluded  from trial if admitting it would bring the administration of justice into  disrepute.   The Ontario Superior Court of Justice agreed  with Mr. McColman, set aside his conviction and acquitted him. When the Court  of Appeal came to the same conclusion, the Crown appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal, set  aside the acquittal and restored the conviction.  <strong>While the evidence was  obtained by the police during an unlawful stop, it should not have been  excluded from trial<em>.</em></strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice  Wagner and Justice O’Bonsawin determined that the officers did not have the  authority under section 48(1) of the HTA to conduct the random sobriety stop in  the private driveway. In their opinion, the HTA defined a “driver” as someone  who drives or has care or control of a vehicle on a highway. A highway is  defined as a “common and public highway, street, avenue […] intended for or  used by the general public”. They said Mr. McColman was not a driver for the  purpose of section 48(1) because he was not on a highway when the police  effected the stop. As such, the stop was unlawful, resulting in the arbitrary  detention of Mr. McColman and the violation of his section 9 <em>Charter </em>rights. Yet, due to the nature and importance of the  evidence, as well as the seriousness of the offence, the Court considered that  admitting the evidence was warranted: “Admission of the evidence in this case  would better serve the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process and  would not damage the long-term repute of the justice system”. For these  reasons, the Court concluded that the evidence obtained by the officers should  not have been excluded from the trial."
2023 SCC 6,"<strong>The  Supreme Court restores a hockey coach’s convictions of voyeurism.  </strong>Randy William Downes of British Columbia was found guilty in 2019 of  voyeurism. He had secretly taken 38 photos of two boys aged between 12 and 14  in their underwear in hockey dressing rooms in Coquitlam and Surrey. Mr. Downes  was the boys’ hockey coach. He also ran a sports photography business from his  home. Upon his return from a brief trip to the United States, officials with  the Canada Border Services Agency searched Mr. Downes’ electronic devices and  found thousands of photos of children engaged in sporting activities. Some of the children were in locker  rooms. Although none of the photos involved nudity or child pornography, the  CBSA alerted the RCMP because of a concern that Mr. Downes might have child  pornography on his home computer. A month later,  while searching Mr. Downes’ home and devices, the RCMP found the photos of the  two boys taken on Mr. Downes’ iPhone without their knowledge. He was charged  with two counts of voyeurism. Under section 162(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>, a person is guilty of voyeurism when they secretly observe or  visually record a person who is in circumstances in which they could reasonably  expect privacy. This may arise in a place where it can reasonably be expected  that people may be nude.<strong> </strong>The trial judge determined that Mr. Downes had secretly taken photos of  the two boys in the hockey dressing rooms and convicted him of voyeurism. Mr.  Downes appealed to British Columbia’s Court of Appeal. A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the  convictions, and ordered a new trial. The majority said the trial judge should  have considered whether nudity was reasonably expected “at the time” Mr. Downes  took the photos. In their view, the offence of voyeurism applied to perpetrators  who expect to observe or record nudity or sexual activity. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and restored Mr. Downes’  convictions.  <strong>The prosecution did not need to  prove that nudity could reasonably be expected in the dressing rooms at the  time the photos were taken. </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Mahmud Jamal said that section  162(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> has no  implicit temporal component. This means that the Crown did not have to prove  that a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in the dressing rooms at  the specific time when the photos were taken. As Justice Jamal explained, it  suffices if the person is in a place where a person may “reasonably be expected to be in such a state [of  undress], such as a changing room, toilet, shower stall, or bedroom”. As  a result, he determined the trial judge had appropriately convicted Mr. Downes  of voyeurism. Justice Jamal arrived at this conclusion by interpreting section  162(1)(a) according to the text of the provision and the purpose for which it  was enacted. With respect to the provision itself, he stated that if Parliament  had intended to include a temporal component to the offence, it could have done  so expressly. Moreover, he determined the purpose of the offence was to protect  the privacy and sexual integrity of individuals. This purpose was best achieved  by interpreting section 162(1)(a) as a location-based offence. The fact that Mr. Downes secretly took photos of the two boys in hockey  dressing rooms, a place where individuals are often in a state of undress, was  sufficient to find him guilty of voyeurism. "
2023 SCC 5,"<strong>The Supreme Court sets aside an Alberta man’s convictions for a 2017 home  invasion robbery.</strong>Shawn Metzger was convicted of offences arising from the home invasion  robbery in June 2017, in the small town of Morningside, Alberta, near Red Deer.  He was allegedly part of a group of three or four perpetrators who stole a  truck. The truck belonged to Mr. Valentin Iten, one of the two victims of the  robbery. The vehicle was found approximately 11 hours later, outside a bar in  Red Deer.Neither of the victims clearly saw the perpetrators during the robbery.  At trial, the prosecution relied on two pieces of evidence to identify Mr. Metzger  as one of the thieves. First, Mr. Metzger’s DNA was on a cigarette butt found  in the stolen truck. Second, Mr. Iten testified that he may have heard someone  say “Metzger” during the robbery. Mr. Metzger did not testify at his trial.Based on this evidence, the trial judge concluded Mr. Metzger participated  in the robbery. Alberta’s Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Metzger’s appeal. It  found the trial judge was correct in determining Mr. Metzger’s guilt in the  robbery. One judge disagreed, which permitted Mr. Metzger to appeal his case to  the Supreme Court of Canada as of right. An appeal “as of right” is available in some criminal cases where one  judge on the court of appeal has dissented on a point of law, as was the case  here. This means the appellant does not need to apply to the Supreme Court of  Canada for permission to have their case heard. The case can be heard if the  appellant simply files a notice to this effect. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal, set aside the convictions and  substituted acquittals.<strong>Mr. Metzger’s convictions were  unreasonable based on the evidence presented at trial. </strong>Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Malcolm Rowe found Mr.  Metzger’s guilty verdicts were unreasonable based on the totality of the evidence.  First, the DNA evidence on its own was insufficient to establish guilt beyond a  reasonable doubt. It only established Mr. Metzger’s presence in the stolen  truck at some point, rather than his participation in the actual robbery. Second,  Mr. Iten’s testimony with respect to hearing the name “Metzger” was fraught  with frailties. He had been struck on the head at the beginning of the robbery,  and was fading in and out of consciousness throughout. During his testimony,  Mr. Iten had questioned his own recollection of what he heard that night.  Justice Rowe also determined that Mr. Metzger’s decision not to testify  at trial could not be raised against him.  The evidence in this case was not such that it  “cried out for an explanation that only [his] testimony could provide”.  For these reasons, Justice Rowe stated that “no trier of fact, acting  judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accused’s guilt was the only  reasonable conclusion available”.  "
2023 SCC 4,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules Canadian military  investigators did not violate the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> while investigating  a Canadian soldier’s criminal activity abroad. </strong>Retired Corporal (Cpl.) Colin McGregor was posted to the Canadian  Defence Liaison Staff at Canada’s embassy in Washington, D.C. Given his  position in the United States, Cpl. McGregor had diplomatic immunity in respect  of his person, property and residence under the <em>Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</em>.In 2017, one of his Canadian Armed Forces colleagues posted to the  United States discovered two audio recording devices in her home. She believed  Cpl. McGregor had placed them there and reported the discovery to her senior  officer. Upon investigating the matter, the Canadian Forces National  Investigation Service found there were reasonable grounds to believe Cpl.  McGregor had committed the offences of voyeurism and possession of a device to  surreptitiously record private communications. Yet, the Investigation Service  could not search his residence in Alexandria, Virginia because it was not  located on Canadian Armed Forces property. As a result, the lead investigator asked  the Canadian Embassy to  waive Cpl. McGregor’s immunity under the <em>Vienna Convention. </em>With immunity waived, the Alexandria  Police Department obtained a warrant that authorized the search of Cpl.  McGregor’s residence, as well as any electronic devices found there. The American police entered Cpl. McGregor’s residence and invited the  Investigation Service to conduct the search. Officers seized electronic devices  and searched some of them while in the residence. They discovered evidence of the  suspected offences as well as others. The electronic devices were removed to  Canada and searched further, in line with Canadian warrants. A military judge dismissed Cpl. McGregor’s motion to exclude the  evidence for breach of section 8 of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, which protects people from “unreasonable  search or seizure”. The military judge convicted him of voyeurism, possession  of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, sexual  assault and disgraceful conduct. That decision was affirmed by the Court  Martial Appeal Court. Cpl. McGregor then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Both  parties relied on this Court’s decision in <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2364/index.do"">R. v.  Hape</a></em> about whether the <em>Charter </em>applies to searches and seizures conducted by Canadian police officers in  other countries. Cpl. McGregor took the position that the <em>Charter</em> applies in this case to the Investigation Service, whereas  the Crown argued the opposite. A unanimous Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed his  convictions.<strong>The investigation did not  violate Cpl. McGregor’s rights under section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. </strong>Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Suzanne Côté found it  unnecessary to deal with the issue of extraterritoriality, because she said the  Investigation Service did not violate the <em>Charter</em>.  Working within the constraints of its authority in Virginia, the Investigation  Service asked local authorities to obtain and execute a warrant under Virginia  law. That warrant authorized the search, seizure and analysis of Cpl.  McGregor’s electronic devices expressly. The evidence of sexual assault was  discovered inadvertently by investigators while triaging the devices at the  scene of the search. Its incriminating nature was immediately apparent.  Although the warrant did not foresee such evidence, the digital files fell into  plain view.As Justice Côté explained, there are two requirements of the plain view  doctrine and in this case they were both met: (1) the investigators had a  legitimate prior justification for the intrusion in the form of a warrant; and  (2) the incriminating evidence was in plain view in that it was immediately  obvious and discovered inadvertently. In addition, the Investigation Service obtained Canadian warrants  before searching the devices any further. For all these reasons, Justice Côté  said it is difficult to see how the investigators could have acted differently  to attain their legitimate investigative objectives. "
2023 SCC 3,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules the mandatory  minimum sentences for robbery using either a prohibited or ordinary firearm do  not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. </strong>On  June 9, 2017, Mr. Ocean William Storm Hilbach and a 13-year-old  accomplice robbed a convenience store in Edmonton, Alberta with an unloaded  sawed-off rifle. With his face concealed, Mr. Hilbach pointed the rifle at  two employees and demanded cash while his accomplice punched one employee and  kicked the other. They left with $290 in lottery tickets and were apprehended  shortly after. At the time, Mr. Hilbach was 19 years old, on  probation and subject to a firearms prohibition order, having been sentenced  for several other offences three months earlier. In  January 2018, Mr. Hilbach pleaded guilty to robbery using a prohibited  firearm contrary to section 344(1)(a)(i) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. At sentencing, Mr. Hilbach brought a challenge  under section 12 of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>to the five-year mandatory minimum sentence.  Section 12 of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees  the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Mr. Hilbach  claimed section 344(1)(a)(i) was grossly disproportionate to him as an  Indigenous person and member of the Ermineskin Cree Nation. Before the  sentencing judge, Mr. Hilbach filed a <em>Gladue </em>report, which indicated that members of his family attended residential  schools, struggled with addictions to alcohol or other substances, and suffered  financial difficulties. The <em>Gladue </em>report  gets its name from the Supreme Court of Canada’s 1999 ruling in <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1695/index.do"">R. v.  Gladue</a></em>, which established factors that courts must take into  account when sentencing Indigenous offenders. In the case of Mr. Hilbach, the  sentencing judge decided that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly  disproportionate and violated section 12. He sentenced Mr. Hilbach to two years  less a day.On  September 13, 2016, in an unrelated case, Mr. Curtis Zwozdesky and two masked  accomplices robbed a convenience store in Caslan, Alberta. One of the  accomplices pushed an employee, pointed a sawed-off shotgun at her, and  demanded cash. A shot was fired into a shelf. Mr. Zwozdesky never entered the  store during the robbery, but drove the accomplices to and from the store. Mr.  Zwozdesky pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm contrary to section  344(1)(a.1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. At  that time, the law imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison.  At sentencing, Mr. Zwozdesky challenged the mandatory minimum sentence under  section 12 of the <em>Charter.</em> The  sentencing judge found that the mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly  disproportionate for Mr. Zwozdesky and sentenced him to three years’  imprisonment. However, she concluded that it would be grossly disproportionate  in reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios and declared the law of no  force or effect. Alberta’s  Court of Appeal heard the two cases together and dismissed the appeals. It also  added a year to Mr. Hilbach’s sentence. It did not change Mr. Zwozdesky’s sentence.  The Crown then appealed both cases to the Supreme Court of Canada.The  Supreme Court allowed the appeals.<strong>The mandatory minimum sentences at  issue are constitutional.</strong>Writing  for a majority of the judges, Justice Sheilah L. Martin ruled that the mandatory  minimum sentences for Mr. Hilbach and Mr. Zwozdesky do not constitute cruel and  unusual punishment. She applied the framework set out in the companion appeal  of <em><a href=""39338-eng.aspx"">R. v. Hills</a></em> for challenges to the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence under  section 12 of the <em>Charter</em>. In regard  to Mr. Hilbach, Justice Martin added that the section 12 analysis makes it  mandatory for judges to consider the unique situation of Indigenous offenders  for all offences in sentencing."
2023 SCC 2,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules the four-year  mandatory minimum sentence for discharging an air-powered pistol or rifle at a house  is unconstitutional. </strong>On May 6, 2014, Mr. Jesse Dallas Hills consumed a  large amount of prescription medication and alcohol. The intoxicated man later left  his Lethbridge, Alberta home with a baseball bat and a loaded rifle designed  for hunting big game. Mr. Hills proceeded to swing his bat at a passing car and  then fire a shot at it. The driver called 9-1-1. Before police arrived, Mr.  Hills turned his attention to an unoccupied parked car. He smashed its windows and  then approached a house. He fired a round that went through the home’s living  room window and through a wall into a computer room before it stopped in a  drywall stud and bookcase.At the time Mr. Hills fired his shots, the home was  occupied by a couple and their two children. The father called 9-1-1, then went  to the basement with the rest of the family where they waited for police to  arrive. The officers discovered that several rounds had penetrated the walls  and windows, into parts of the home where someone could have been hit.After a preliminary inquiry, Mr. Hills pled guilty  to four offences, including discharging a firearm into or at a house contrary  to section 244.2(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. At the time, this offence carried a four-year mandatory minimum  sentence set out in section 244.2(3)(b). Mr. Hills challenged the sentence under  section 12 of the <em>Charter</em>, which guarantees  the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. He argued the  mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate and therefore constituted  cruel and unusual punishment. His challenge relied on a hypothetical scenario,  where a young person intentionally discharges an air-powered pistol or rifle at  a residence that is incapable of perforating the walls of a home.The sentencing judge found that the sentence in the  hypothetical scenario was grossly disproportionate. He sentenced Mr. Hills to three  and a half years in prison. The Crown appealed the judge’s finding and the  sentence. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on both grounds. It restored the  mandatory minimum sentence and sentenced Mr. Hills to four years in prison. Mr.  Hills then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The  Supreme Court allowed the appeal.<strong>The four-year mandatory minimum  sentence set out in section 244.2(3)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> is cruel and unusual punishment. </strong>Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice  Sheilah L. Martin ruled that the four-year mandatory minimum sentence set  out in section 244.2(3)(b) is grossly disproportionate in the hypothetical  scenario raised by Mr. Hills. It infringes section 12 of the <em>Charter</em> and cannot be saved by section 1.  It is immediately declared of no force or effect and this declaration applies  retroactively. The three-and-a-half-year sentence imposed on Mr. Hill by the  sentencing judge is reinstated.The evidence showed that many  air-powered rifles, such as paintball guns, are considered “firearms”, even  though they could not perforate the wall of a typical residence. The majority  found that the provision applies to a wide spectrum of conduct, ranging from  acts that present little danger to the public, to those that pose a grave risk.  It is also reasonably foreseeable that a young person could intentionally  discharge such a “firearm” into a home. As Justice Martin said, “it would shock  the conscience of Canadians to learn that an offender can receive four years of  imprisonment for firing a paintball gun at a home”. In arriving at this conclusion,  Justice Martin further developed the framework applicable to challenges to the  constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence under section 12 of the <em>Charter</em>. To determine if a mandatory  minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate, the court must take two steps.  First, a court must determine a fit and proportionate sentence for the offence,  in line with the objectives and principles of sentencing in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The court must then decide  if the mandatory sentence is grossly disproportionate to the fit and  proportionate sentence. The outcome will depend on the scope and reach of the  offence, the effects of the punishment on the offender, as well as the penalty  and its objectives.  "
2024 SCC 38,"<strong>The Supreme Court sets  aside a man’s acquittals for trafficking in persons and orders a new trial.</strong>This appeal addresses whether  evidence of past violence may be relevant to the offence of trafficking in persons  in a criminal prosecution.From 2004 to 2012, the complainant  and the accused were in a common law relationship that was plagued by violence  and financial difficulties. According to the complainant, the accused persuaded  her to have sex on a webcam for money, dance for men, and offer sexual services  for money, which she did because of the accused’s violence and threats towards  her. She also claimed that the accused was deeply involved in the sexual services, including posting ads offering sexual  services, and received all the money. She  stated that this continued  until she left the accused in 2012. The accused was charged with trafficking in  persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections  279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. At trial, the  complainant and five other witnesses provided evidence of the accused’s  violence towards the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the accused. He  accepted that the complainant was in a violent relationship with the accused, but  he found her testimony lacking in credibility. He also had a reasonable doubt  about the accused’s ties to any prostitution enterprise. He considered the evidence  from the other witnesses as backdrop, but not in relation to the alleged  offences, concluding that it related to “past discreditable conduct”. Evidence  of past discreditable conduct relates to past misconduct of the accused that  goes beyond what is alleged by the prosecution in relation to an offence and is  not normally admissible. The Crown appealed the  acquittals to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge should have  considered the evidence of the other witnesses about the accused’s violence  towards the complainant. The majority of the Court of Appeal confirmed the  acquittals. It held that the trial judge was wrong to conclude that the accused’s violence was past discreditable conduct but that  the error did not have a significant impact on the  acquittals. The majority also concluded that the trial judge did not fail  to consider all the evidence. The dissenting judge would have ordered a new  trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence, and  that treating the accused’s violence as past discreditable conduct  misapprehended its nature and relevance to the elementsof both offences that the Crown needed to establish. The Crown  appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has  allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial.<strong>Evidence of regular violence, threats of violence, and a  violent relationship may be relevant to the elements of the offence of  trafficking in persons.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice O’Bonsawin concluded that the trial judge assessed the  evidence based on a wrong legal principle by determining that the evidence of  violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was  evidence of past discreditable conduct. This error of law hindered his  assessment of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary  foundation relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in  persons offence and the definition of exploitation set  out in section 279.04 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. The trial  judge’s error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals. They should  therefore be set aside and a new trial ordered."
2024 SCC 37,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds  guidelines used to assess certain property for municipal tax purposes in Alberta. </strong>This appeal and <em><a href=""40582-eng.aspx"">Auer  v. Auer</a></em>, which was released on the same day, are both about the  standard of review that applies when subordinate legislation is challenged on  judicial review before a court. Subordinate legislation sets out legally  binding rules that are not made by a legislature, such as the Legislative  Assembly of Alberta, but instead by another entity given authority to make them  by that legislature.<strong> </strong>The standard of  review is the approach a court takes to analyzing a decision, like a decision  to make subordinate legislation.TransAlta  Generation Partnership owns coal-fired electric power generation  facilities in Alberta. In 2016, TransAlta entered into an agreement with  Alberta. It agreed to cease  coal-fired emissions on or before December 31, 2030, in exchange for  substantial transition payments from Alberta for 14 years to compensate for losses  resulting from the reduced life of its coal-fired facilities. TransAlta’s  coal-fired facilities are assessed as “linear property” for municipal tax  purposes. Alberta’s <em>Municipal Government Act </em>authorizes the Minister of  Municipal Affairs to establish guidelines for assessing the value of linear  property. In 2017, the Minister  established the <em>2017 Alberta Linear  Property Assessment Minister’s Guidelines </em>under the Act. The  Guidelines, which are subordinate  legislation, deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim a more favourable tax position because  of the reduction in its facilities’ lifespan resulting from the off-coal agreement. TransAlta said the Minister had gone beyond his authority in making the Guidelines  (that they were <em>ultra vires</em>) because they  are discriminatory and inconsistent with the purposes of the Act.The Court of King’s  Bench said the Guidelines were valid and did not discriminate against TransAlta. The Court  of Appeal dismissed TransAlta’s appeal.  The Court of Appeal held that the principles articulated in the Supreme Court  of Canada’s decision in <em>Katz Group  Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care)</em> determined how the  Guidelines should be reviewed. That decision says that in order to find subordinate  legislation to be beyond the authority  granted by a statute because it is inconsistent with the purpose of that  statute, it had to be shown that it was  “irrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated” to the purpose. The Court of Appeal  held that the subsequent decision  in <em><a href=""../2019/37748-eng.aspx"">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em> did not  change these principles. Following <em>Vavilov</em>,the presumptive standard of review is  reasonableness. A reasonable decision  is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It has to make sense in light of the  law and the facts, but need not be the only right answer. TransAlta appealed again to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed its appeal. <strong>The  guidelines fall reasonably within the scope of the Minister’s authority under Alberta’s <em>Municipal Government Act</em>.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Côté explained that the reasonableness standard under <em>Vavilov</em> presumptively applies when  reviewing whether subordinate legislation was authorized by law. Certain  principles from <em>Katz Group </em>continue  to inform reasonableness review, but for a court to  find subordinate legislation to be beyond  the authority granted in statute because  it is inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it no longer  needs to be “irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated” to that purpose. The  governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law rules, and  the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant  constraints when determining whether subordinate  legislation falls reasonably within the scope of the authority. In the instant case, no exception to the  presumption of reasonableness review applies. Having regard to the governing  statutory scheme, the principles of statutory interpretation, and the common  law rule against administrative discrimination, the Guidelines are within the scope  of the Minister’s authority."
2024 SCC 36,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds guidelines  used to determine child support amounts in case of divorce.</strong>This appeal and <a href=""40570-eng.aspx""><em>TransAlta Generation Partnership v. Alberta</em></a>, which was released on the  same day, are both about the standard of review that applies when subordinate  legislation is challenged on judicial review before a court. Subordinate  legislation sets out legally binding rules that are not made by a legislature,  such as federal Parliament, but instead by another entity given authority to  make them by that legislature. The  standard of review is the approach a court takes to analyzing a decision, like  a decision to make subordinate legislation.Mr. Roland Auer and  Ms. Aysel Auer were married in 2004. They had one child together and divorced  in 2008. Mr. Auer paid child support to Ms. Auer, but brought an application  for judicial review challenging the <em>Federal Child Support Guidelines</em>, subordinate legislation which determines the  amount of child support to be paid in case of divorce. The Governor in Council  (the Governor General acting on the advice of Cabinet) has authority under the <em>Divorce Act </em>to make guidelines dealing  with orders for such child support. Mr. Auer argued that the Governor in  Council had gone beyond this authority in making the <em>Guidelines</em> (that they were <em>ultra  vires</em>) because they require a payer parent like Mr. Auer to pay a greater  share of the child-related costs than the recipient parent.The Court of King’s  Bench concluded that the Guidelines were within the authority of the Governor  in Council to makeand dismissed Mr. Auer’s application for judicial  review. It held that, following a decision of the  Supreme Court of Canada called <a href=""../2019/37748-eng.aspx""><em>Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  Immigration) v. Vavilov</em></a>, reasonableness is the presumptive  standard of review for assessing whether there was authority to make subordinate  legislation. A reasonable decision is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It  has to make sense in light of the law and the facts, but need not be the only  right answer. The Court of King’s  Bench also said that  reasonableness  review should be informed by the principles outlined in an earlier Supreme  Court case called <em>Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term  Care)</em>. That decision says that in order to find subordinate  legislation to be beyond the authority granted by a statute because it is  inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it had to be shown that it  was “irrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated” to the purpose.The Court of Appeal  unanimously dismissed Mr. Auer’s appeal but was divided on the standard of  review. A majority held that <em>Vavilov </em>did not change the principles from <em>Katz  Group</em> and that to conclude the Guidelineswere not authorized by the <em>Divorce Act</em> because they wereinconsistent with the purpose of that  Act, they had to be “irrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated” to that  purpose.Mr. Auer appealed again to the Supreme Court of  Canada, arguing that the Guidelineswere  not authorized by law. The Supreme Court has dismissed his appeal.<strong>The guidelines fall reasonably within the scope  of the Governor in Council’s authority under the <em>Divorce Act</em>.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Côté explained that <em>Vavilov</em>’s robust reasonableness standard is the presumptive standard for  reviewing whether subordinate legislation was authorized by law. Some of the  principles from <em>Katz Group</em> continue  to inform such reasonableness review. However, for a court to find subordinate legislation to be beyond the authority granted in statute because it is  inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it no  longer needs to be “irrelevant”, “extraneous” or “completely unrelated” to that  statutory purpose. The governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory  or common law rules and the principles of statutory interpretation are  particularly relevant constraints when  determining whether subordinate legislation falls reasonably within the scope  of the authority.In the instant case, the Guidelines fall reasonably within the  Governor in Council’s scope of authority under the <em>Divorce Act</em>, having regard to the relevant  constraints. Under s. 26.1(1), the Governor in Council is granted  extremely broad authority to establish guidelines respecting child support.  Section 26.1(2) constrains this authority by requiring that the guidelines be  based on the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to  maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative  abilities to contribute. The Guidelinesrespect this constraint.

2024 SCC 35,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that new restrictions on the availability of preliminary inquiries do not apply  to certain ongoing criminal proceedings.</strong>This is an appeal about the interpretation of a new rule limiting  who is eligible to have a preliminary inquiry as part of their criminal  proceedings. A preliminary inquiry is a hearing before a court to determine  whether there is enough evidence against an accused person to proceed with a  trial.In unrelated cases, Agénor Archambault and  Gilles Grenier were charged with one or more historical sexual offences against  a child. After the dates of the alleged offences and before charges were laid in  2019, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased from 10 to 14  years’ imprisonment. Since the law in place at the time  of the alleged crime governs the maximum sentence, the maximum that applies to  the cases of Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier is 10 years, not 14 years.In 2020, Mr. Archambault and  Mr. Grenier each requested a preliminary inquiry. However, under an  amendment to s. 535 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> that took effect on September 19, 2019, the availability of  preliminary inquiries was now restricted to accused persons charged with  offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment. In both cases,  the Crown argued that, under the amended version of s. 535, the court  could not hold a preliminary inquiry.The Court of Québec held that the new  s. 535 applied to Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier and that it  lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry. Both of them  challenged that interpretation before the Superior Court but were unsuccessful.  They argued that they had the right to a preliminary inquiry because the new  rule in s. 535 did not apply to their proceedings. They also argued that even  under the new rule they were still entitled to a preliminary inquiry. They said  their offences should be considered punishable by 14 years or more for the  purposes of the new rule.The Court of Appeal  allowed their further appeals and sent the cases back to the Court of Québec  for preliminary inquiries. The  Court of Appeal concluded that the amended version of s. 535 did not apply  to Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier. They had an entitlement to  preliminary inquiries before s. 535 was amended. The Court of Appeal  decided that the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry is based on the date of  the alleged offence. Given its conclusion, the Court of Appeal did not address  the question of how the amended version of s. 535 should be interpreted.The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier were not entitled to a preliminary inquiry. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.<strong>A  preliminary inquiry is available where the person is charged with an offence for  which they actually face a maximum sentence of at least 14 years</strong><strong> and in some other cases on  a transitional basis.</strong>A majority of the Court held that both Mr.  Archambault and Mr. Grenier were entitled to the preliminary inquiries they  requested. The old version of s. 535 continued to apply to them, rather than  the new rule. The fact that they had not requested a preliminary inquiry before  the change in the law was not determinative of their entitlement to preliminary  inquiries.A different majority of the  Court held that neither Mr. Archambault nor Mr. Grenier was eligible for a  preliminary inquiry under the new rule if it applied, as the offences were each  punishable by a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment. The new rule in s. 535  requires that the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years’ imprisonment  in respect of the offence with which they are charged for a preliminary inquiry  to be available."
2024 SCC 34,"<strong>The Supreme Court sets  aside a driving prohibition order because that sentence was not available to  the sentencing judge under the Criminal Code.</strong>This appeal deals with the interpretation  of s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,  which allows a judge to impose a driving prohibition where a person has been  found guilty of one of the specified driving offences.Braydon Wolfe drove on the wrong  side of a divided highway and caused a head-on collision, killing two people  and seriously injuring another. He was found guilty of two counts of criminal  negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily  harm. In his reasons, the trial judge held that, if his analysis of the  criminal negligence counts was wrong, then he would convict the accused of two  counts of dangerous driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving  causing bodily injury. In addition to sentencing the accused to terms of  imprisonment, the trial judge issued a driving prohibition order imposing  concurrent 10-year driving prohibitions for each criminal negligence causing  death count and a concurrent 7-year prohibition for the criminal negligence  causing bodily harm count. Concurrent sentences are sentences for more than one  crime which are to be served at one time. Mr. Wolfe appealed against the length  of the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge. On appeal, the  court raised the question of whether the driving prohibitions could stand in  light of recent amendments to the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr.  Wolfe’s sentence appeal. With respect to the availability of the driving  prohibition order, the court interpreted s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which permits sentencing  judges to impose a driving prohibition where an offender has been “found  guilty” of one of the offences specified in that provision, as authorizing that  order, even though the offences are not specified offences. It held that the  criminal negligence convictions necessarily included a finding of guilt for the  lesser offence of dangerous driving, which is one of the offences specified in  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  Mr. Wolfe appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that recent  amendments to the <em>Criminal Code </em>did  not allow the sentencing judge to impose driving prohibition orders.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal and set aside the driving prohibition order imposed on Mr. Wolfe.<strong>Driving prohibitions could not be ordered because that sentence was not  available as an option to the sentencing judge.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin held that the driving prohibitions imposed on Mr. Wolfe  were unlawful. Mr. Wolfe was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and  criminal negligence causing bodily harm, which are not specified offences under  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. He  was not “found guilty” of a specified offence within the meaning of that  provision. Accordingly, discretionary driving prohibitions were not available  as a sentencing option.

2024 SCC 33,"<strong>The Supreme Court affirms a  man’s conviction of firearms offences.</strong>In 2019, members of the Regina police’s street gang  unit stopped Stuart Sabiston while he was walking down an alley and arrested  him for possession of stolen property. Mr. Sabiston told police that he had a loaded  sawed-off shotgun in his backpack. The police searched his backpack, seized the  firearm, and arrested him again for a number of firearms offences. The Crown  ultimately did not proceed with the possession of stolen property charge. At trial for the firearms offences, Mr. Sabiston  argued that the police had breached his <em>Charter</em> rights, namely his section 8rightagainst unreasonable search or seizure,  and his section 9 right to not be arbitrarily detained. The trial judge found  that the police had breached Mr. Sabiston’s <em>Charter</em> rights because his initial arrest for possession of stolen property was  unlawful, as was the search of his backpack that followed. However, she found  that the evidence of the firearm should be admitted at trial under section 24(2)  of the <em>Charter</em>. This section says  that evidence obtained in a way that breached the rights of an accused may be  excluded from trial if admitting it would bring the administration of justice  into disrepute. To determine whether the evidence in question should be  excluded, a court will look at three indicators: (1) the seriousness of the  state conduct in breach of the <em>Charter</em>; (2) the impact of the  breach on the accused; and (3) society’s interest in adjudicating the matter on  its merits. The trial judge found that the police would have been able to  legally detain Mr. Sabiston to investigate him, which made the breaches less  serious. Mr. Sabiston was convicted of several offences.A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed Mr.  Sabiston’s appeal. It found that the police could not have legally detained Mr.  Sabiston, and therefore could not have found the firearm without breaching his <em>Charter</em> rights. It decided that the  evidence of the firearm should be excluded from trial, set aside Mr. Sabiston’s  conviction, and substituted an acquittal. The dissenting judge would have  dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction. He found that the trial judge  was permitted to consider that the police would have detained Mr. Sabiston and  discovered the firearm if the <em>Charter</em> breaches had not occurred.<strong>The Supreme Court allowed the appeal. </strong>Mr. Sabiston’s acquittal  was set aside and his conviction restored.Justice Côté read the  judgment of a majority of the Court.

2024 SCC 32,"<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that claims against a company operating a Ponzi scheme are not  statute-barred. </strong>Joseph  Lacasse owned and operated Golden Oaks Enterprises Inc, a rent-to-own residential  property company. Lorne Scott, one of the  appellants, was a real estate agent who was paid interest and commissions to  recruit new investors. The company  appeared to be successful, but, in reality, was a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme  is a form of fraud in which existing investors are paid with funds collected  from new investors. In this case, Mr. Lacasse lured investors to lend money to  the company for unlawfully high interest rates, and then paid existing  investors by recruiting new investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed in July 2013.  Doyle Salewski Inc. served as the “trustee in bankruptcy”. A trustee  administers the property of a bankrupt person under the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act </em>(“<em>BIA</em>”).  Salewski started legal proceedings against the investors to recover the illegal  interest and commissions they were paid by Golden Oaks, arguing that they were  unjustly enriched. The investors argued in response that the actions were  statute-barred under Ontario’s <em>Limitations  Act, 2002</em>, because Mr. Lacasse knew of the illegal payments when they were  made. The <em>Limitations Act, 2002 </em>says  that legal proceedings generally cannot be started more than two years after  the person making the claim knew or ought to have known of the claims. After  that point, they become “statute-barred”.The  trial judge attributed Mr. Lacasse’s knowledge to the company. However, she found  that the trustee’s actions against the company were not statute-barred for  other reasons. She ordered the investors to return the illegal interest  payments they had received. The investors appealed the trial judge’s decision,  arguing that she had wrongly concluded that the actions were not statute-barred.  The trustee also appealed the trial judge’s decision that Mr. Lacasse’s  knowledge should be attributed to Golden Oaks. The  Court of Appeal did not accept the investors’ arguments, and agreed with the  trustee that the trial judge should not have attributed Mr. Lacasse’s knowledge  to the company. The Court of Appeal concluded that there are public interest reasons  to ensure that those who benefitted from the Ponzi scheme could not avoid being  held responsible in legal proceedings by attributing Mr. Lacasse’s knowledge to  the company. The legal proceedings were therefore not statute-barred because Golden  Oaks did not have the knowledge to bring the actions at the relevant time. The  investors appealed to the Supreme Court, primarily on the grounds that Mr.  Lacasse’s knowledge must be attributed to Golden Oaks, because it is a  one-person corporation and the two are essentially the same. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The knowledge of the sole officer and  shareholder of Golden Oaks should not be attributed to the corporation.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice Jamal concluded that the trustee’s actions are not  statute-barred by the <em>Limitations Act,  2002</em>. The principles of the corporate attribution doctrine, summarized in  the companion appeal <em>Aquino v. Ernest  &amp; Young Inc.</em>, 2024 SCC 31, apply to one-person corporations. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. The Court of Appeal was therefore correct to  conclude that Mr. Lacasse’s knowledge should not be attributed to the company.  This would not have promoted the purposes of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> or the <em>BIA</em>,  which include avoiding the injustice of barring a claim before a person is able  to make it, and ensuring a fair distribution of the bankrupt person’s assets  and protecting the public interest. "
2024 SCC 31,"<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that the fraudulent intent of the president of two construction  companies can be attributed to the companies in bankruptcy proceedings.</strong>This  appeal addressed when a court can attribute the intent of a senior officer or  employee, known as a “directing mind”, to the corporation. John  Aquino was the president of two family-owned construction companies that worked  on large-sale construction projects. When the companies began experiencing  serious financial difficulties, investigations revealed that Mr. Aquino and  several others had been fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from  the companies through a false invoicing scheme. For years, they created fake  invoices from fake suppliers for services that were never provided, and then  directed the construction companies to pay the invoices. In bankruptcy  proceedings against the companies, these payments were challenged under s.  96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>Bankruptcy and  Insolvency Act</em> (“<em>BIA</em>”). This  provision allows for the recovery of money if a transaction is a “transfer at  undervalue” and the debtor intended to “defraud, defeat or delay a creditor”. A  transfer at undervalue is a transaction where property or services are provided  to another person for nothing in exchange or for much less than fair market  value. The  application judge concluded that the false invoice payments were transfers at  undervalue. She found that the payments involved several “badges of fraud”,  which are suspicious circumstances that may help prove fraudulent intent. She  rejected the argument that the construction companies could not have had fraudulent  intent because they were paying their creditors in full and on time at the time  of the payments. She considered the purpose of bankruptcy legislation, which is  to provide a remedy to creditors, and concluded that Mr. Aquino’s intent should  be attributed to the companies. She ordered Mr. Aquino and others to pay the  money they received under the scheme. Mr. Aquino and the others involved in the  scheme appealed the application judge’s ruling. Both before the Court of Appeal  and the Supreme Court, they repeated the arguments made before the application  judge. The Court of Appeal upheld the application judge’s ruling. <strong>The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.</strong>Writing  for the Court, Justice Jamal concluded that the application judge did not  misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent. A court  may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under  s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>BIA </em>even if  the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfer at undervalue. There  is therefore no basis to interfere with the application judge’s conclusion that  Mr. Aquino intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor under the false  invoicing scheme. Furthermore, Mr. Aquino’s fraudulent intent should be  attributed to the debtor companies because he was their directing mind and  acted in the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to him. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. In the context of a claim under s. 96 of the <em>BIA</em>, the “fraud” and “no benefit” exceptions  to corporate attribution should not apply because these exceptions would  undermine the purpose of this provision. The test for corporate attribution  under s. 96 is simply whether the person was the directing mind and whether  their actions were performed within the sector or corporate responsibility  assigned to them."
2024 SCC 30,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that airlines can be required to compensate passengers for certain  international flight disruptions.</strong>This is an appeal about whether a federal agency  can require airlines to pay compensation to passengers for certain  international flight disruptions. It addresses whether that compensation is  consistent with a treaty dealing with some aspects of international air travel. In 2018, Parliament amended the <em>Canada Transportation Act</em> (“CTA”) to  require that the Canadian Transportation Agency make regulations establishing  what it described as a “new air passenger rights regime”. In 2019, the Agency  made the <em>Air Passenger Protection  Regulations</em>. The Regulations say what airlines have to do for passengers in  the case of international flight delays, cancellations and denial of boarding,  which in some cases includes paying a set minimum amount of compensation. They  also require airlines to refund baggage fees paid by passengers when an airline  has lost or damaged their baggage on international flights.The International Air Transport Association, the  Air Transportation Association of America, and several airlines (collectively,  “airlines”) challenged certain provisions of the Regulations before the Federal  Court of Appeal. The airlines said that the provisions were not consistent with  the <em>Convention for the Unification of  Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air</em> (“Montreal Convention”) and  fell outside the Agency’s regulation-making authority under the CTA. The Montreal Convention is an international  agreement that Canada signed in 2001 and that has been implemented into  Canadian law. It sets out certain conditions and limits on what airlines can be  required to pay passengers to compensate for international flight disruptions. Article  29 of the Montreal Convention says that any “action for damages” within the  scope of the agreement is subject to those conditions and limits. This is  called the “exclusivity principle”, because it prevents a person from bringing  an “action for damages” not subject to the conditions and limits even if there  is another basis in law to do so.The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the  challenge brought by the airlines, with the exception of the provisions  relating to the temporary loss of baggage. It considered the compatibility of  the Regulations with the Montreal Convention, and concluded that the  compensation provided for under the Regulations is not an “action for damages”.The Airlines appealed to the Supreme Court  seeking an order setting aside certain provisions of the Regulations as they  relate to international air travel. The Supreme Court has dismissed the Airlines’  appeal.<strong>The  compensation payable to passengers is not individualized and is not therefore an  “action for damages” limited by the Montreal Convention.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Rowe explained  that the Montreal Convention is exclusive within the scope of the matters that  it addresses but does not deal comprehensively with all aspects of  international carriage by air. Under Article 29, there must be an “action” that  leads to “damages” for the exclusivity principle to apply. However, the  Regulations do not provide for an “action for damages” because they do not  provide for individualized compensation. Rather, they create a consumer  protection scheme that operates in parallel with the Montreal Convention, without  trenching on its liability limitation provisions. Thus, they do not fall within  the scope of the Montreal Convention’s exclusivity principle. Since the  Regulations do not give rise to liability that is pre-empted by Article 29,  they do not conflict with the Montreal Convention and there is no basis to  conclude that they are outside the jurisdiction of the Agency."
2024 SCC 29,"<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial because of the erroneous admission of an out‑of‑court  statement at trial.</strong>This appeal concerns  the admissibility in evidence of an out‑of‑court statement made by a trial witness.Following an incident  involving the accused and the complainant at the school they attended, the  accused was charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm and  uttering threats. At trial, the complainant testified that he had entered a  washroom at the school and had felt something on his hip while washing his  hands. When he turned around, he saw that it was a pistol held by the accused,  being used to threaten him. Two other students were present at the time. One of  them, who testified at the accused’s trial, claimed to have no recollection of  the events. The prosecution therefore requested a <em>voir dire</em>, seeking the admission into evidence of an out‑of‑court  statement given by that witness to the police investigators the day after the  events. A <em>voir dire</em> is a proceeding  held in the absence of the jury during a criminal trial to allow the judge to consider,  for example, the admissibility of evidence that a party wishes to present. The witness had  been questioned by the police investigators for about an hour and had provided  a written statement. Among other things, the witness admitted in his statement  that he was in possession of two pellet pistols. The police conducted a search  and recovered the pistols at the witness’s residence. The trial judge admitted  the witness’s out‑of‑court statement into evidence. The judge found that the  only likely explanation for the statement was its truthfulness as to its  material aspects, given the circumstances in which the statement was made and  the seizure of pistols, which the judge considered to be corroborative  evidence. Corroborative evidence is evidence that reinforces other evidence. Following the trial, the  accused was found guilty of the three charges. The judge accepted the  complainant’s version of events, which was supported by a surveillance video  and the witness’s statement. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the trial  judge’s decision to admit the statement into evidence and dismissed the  accused’s appeal. The Supreme  Court of Canada has allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions. The Court  has also ordered a new trial. <strong>The out‑of‑court statement did not have the  indicia of reliability required to be admitted at trial.</strong>Writing for  the majority of the Court, Justice Moreau determined that the trial judge had erred  in finding that the witness’s out‑of‑court statement had the required indicia  of reliability and in admitting the statement into evidence at trial. The  results of the search subsequently conducted at the witness’s residence do not  meet the criteria for corroborative evidence laid down by the Supreme Court in <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16702/index.do"">R.  v. Bradshaw</a></em>. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the statement do  not support a finding that threshold reliability is established. Finally, the  majority of the Court of Appeal should not have relied on the complainant’s  testimony, given outside of the <em>voir dire</em>,  to hold that the threshold reliability of the witness’s statement was  established. "
2024 SCC 28,"<strong>The Supreme Court concludes that bankruptcy does not release people from orders to pay amounts obtained by fraud, but  could release them from administrative penalties.</strong>This appeal is  about whether bankruptcy releases  persons from having to comply with certain orders imposed on them by a regulatory  agency for having broken the law. Bankruptcy is a legal process through which a  person can be released, or discharged, from having to pay certain debts,  subject to conditions.Between 2007 and 2009, Thalbinder  Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian engaged in a scheme in which they manipulated  the share price of a public oil and gas company called OSE Corp. and then sold  the overpriced shares to investors. The scheme caused vulnerable investors to  lose millions of dollars. In 2014, the British Columbia  Securities Commission found that the Poonians had violated the province’s <em>Securities Act</em>. It eventually ordered  them to pay $13.5 million in administrative penalties. Administrative penalties  are consequences for having broken the law that are imposed by administrative  tribunals or regulatory agencies instead of the courts. The Commission also  ordered the Poonians to pay a further $5.6 million, representing the amounts  they had obtained as a result of the scheme. These are called “disgorgement  orders”. In 2018, the Poonians went into  bankruptcy. Section 178(1) of the federal <em>Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act</em> lists certain debts from which a person is not released  through bankruptcy (debts that are “exempted from discharge”). The Commission asked  the Supreme Court of British Columbia to decide whether the amounts owed to it  by the Poonians would be exempted from discharge, based on this rule. The Supreme Court of British  Columbia said that the orders would be exempted from discharge. It found that  the exceptions in s. 178(1)(a) — relating to penalties “imposed by a court” —  and in s. 178(1)(e) — relating to debt that results from “obtaining property or  services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation” — both applied. The Poonians’ appeal to the Court  of Appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal concluded that although the s.  178(1)(a) exception did not apply because the Commission’s decisions were not  “imposed by a court”, the exception in s. 178(1)(e) did apply. The Poonians  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal in part. It has reversed the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the  administrative penalties are exempted from discharge under s. 178(1)(e), while  upholding its conclusion that the disgorgement orders are exempted.<strong>Orders to pay  amounts that were obtained by fraud are directly linked to that fraud in a way  that administrative penalties are not.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Côté held that neither the administrative penalties nor the disgorgement orders  are exempted from discharge pursuant to s. 178(1)(a). The words “imposed by a  court” in s. 178(1)(a) do not capture orders made by administrative tribunals  or regulatory agencies, such as the Commission, that are subsequently  registered as judgments of a court. In addition, the administrative  penalties do not come within the exception in s. 178(1)(e), as they did not  result directly from the fraudulent scheme; rather, they arose indirectly as a  result of the Commission’s decision to sanction the Poonians. The disgorgement  orders, however, are captured by the s. 178(1)(e) exception as there is a  direct link between them and the Poonians’ fraudulent conduct. Therefore, they  will not be released by any possible future order of discharge."
2024 SCC 27,"<strong>The Supreme Court requires  the Crown to negotiate or, failing agreement, determine the compensation it  owes to First Nations for breaching its treaty promises.</strong>This judgment clarifies the rights  and obligations of the Crown and the Anishinaabe of Lake Huron and Lake  Superior under two historic treaties, and what the Crown must do to address its  breaches of those treaties. In 1850, the Anishinaabe of Lake  Huron and Lake Superior entered into treaties with the Crown, known as the  Robinson Treaties. Under the treaties, the Anishinaabe agreed to cede their  territories to the Crown and the Crown promised to provide in return an annuity  (a perpetual annual payment). The treaties provided for the increase of the  annuities over time under certain circumstances. This part of the treaty, known  as the “Augmentation Clause”, also provided that the amount “paid to each  individual” each year would not exceed £1 (equivalent to $4), but the Crown had the power to increase it to a higher amount chosen  in its discretion. The annuities  were increased to $4 to each individual in 1875, but have not increased since  then.The Anishinaabe of Lake Superior (“Superior  plaintiffs”) filed a claim against the Crown in 2001 and the Anishinaabe of  Lake Huron filed their own claim in 2014 (“Huron plaintiffs”). Both plaintiffs alleged  the Crown had breached the Augmentation Clause and its fiduciary duty. Fiduciary  duty means that Canada is obliged to act in the best interest of Indigenous  Peoples. The plaintiffs asked the court to compensate them. The trial judge concluded that,  under the Augmentation Clause, the Crown must increase the annuities when the  economic circumstances warrant it, reflecting a “fair share” of the revenues  received by the Crown from the land. The trial judge said that the honour of  the Crown and a fiduciary duty required the Crown to diligently implement the  Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed from these decisions, arguing that  the trial judge was wrong in her interpretation of the Robinson Treaties. The Court of Appeal allowed Ontario’s appeals in part. The Court of  Appeal agreed that the honour of the Crown applied to the case. A majority of the  Court of Appeal agreed that the Crown is required to increase the annuities  when the economic conditions warrant it, but did not agree that the treaties  promised a fair share of revenues. The Court of Appeal also agreed that the  Crown’s power under the Augmentation Clause to decide whether to increase the  annuities is not unfettered. Unfettered means without any constraints. The  Court of Appeal also found that the Crown was not under a fiduciary duty in  relation to the Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada on a number of issues, including the proper interpretation of the  Augmentation Clause, the nature and content of the Crown’s obligation to give  effect to that clause, and the appropriate remedy for its breach. The Huron and  Superior plaintiffs cross‑appealed on the question of the Crown’s fiduciary duties. Before the Court, neither  Canada nor Ontario disputed that they are in longstanding breach of the annuity  promises.The Supreme Court has allowed  Ontario’s appeals in part, dismissed the plaintiffs’ cross-appeals,  and issued a declaration about the rights and obligations under the  Augmentation Clause. <strong>An opportunity for negotiation and agreement outside the courtroom has  greater potential to renew the treaty relationship, advance reconciliation, and  restore the honour of the Crown.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Jamal held that  the interpretation of historic Crown-Indigenous treaties is reviewable for  correctness. This means that an appeal court can substitute its interpretation  for that of the lower court if deemed incorrect. Applying this standard of  review to this case, along with the relevant treaty interpretation principles,  Justice Jamal said that the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time,  whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. If the Crown can  increase the annuities beyond $4 to each individual, it must exercise its discretion  and decide whether to do so and, if so, by how much. This discretion is not  unfettered; it must be exercised liberally, justly, and in accordance with the  honour of the Crown. The frequency with which the Crown must consider whether  it can increase the annuities must also be consistent with the honour of the  Crown. Justice Jamal added that, given the longstanding and  egregious nature of the Crown’s breach of the Augmentation Clause, the Crown  must exercise its discretion and increase the annuities with respect to the  past. Having already reached a negotiated settlement concerning past breaches  with the Huron plaintiffs, the Crown is directed to engage in time-bound and  honourable negotiation with the Superior plaintiffs about compensation for past  breaches. Finally, although no specific fiduciary duties apply in respect of  the augmentation promise, the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to  diligently fulfill this promise. "
2024 SCC 26,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that the state can be required to pay damages for making unconstitutional  legislation in limited circumstances.</strong>This appeal is about whether the state is immune from liability for  damages when it makes legislation that courts later find to be unconstitutional.  Immunity from liability for damages means a situation in which courts cannot  require the payment of such damages.Joseph Power says he applied for  a record suspension in 2013 but his application was denied. A record suspension  allows people who were convicted of a criminal offence, but have completed  their sentence and demonstrated that they are law-abiding citizens, to have  their criminal record kept separate and apart from other criminal records in  some circumstances. Mr. Power says his criminal record prevented him from  working in the field in which he had trained.At the time of Mr. Power’s conviction  in 1996, persons convicted of indictable offences could apply for a record suspension five years  after their release. An indictable offence is a category of more serious criminal  offences. Legislation enacted in 2010 and 2012 rendered Mr. Power permanently ineligible  for a record suspension. This legislation was declared unconstitutional by  courts in other proceedings and the Attorney General of Canada agrees that it violates the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  Mr. Power says he is owed damages under s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter </em>for the breach of his rights caused by the enactment of the  legislation.The Attorney General of Canada asked  the court hearing Mr. Power’s claim to answer two questions. First, can the  state be required to pay damages for governments preparing and drafting a Bill  that later became law, and was subsequently declared unconstitutional? Second,  can the state be required to pay damages for Parliament enacting a Bill into  law, which was later declared unconstitutional?The Court  of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick answered  “yes” to both questions, finding that the state was entitled to only a limited  immunity from <em>Charter</em> damages for  unconstitutional legislation. The Court of Appeal of New  Brunswick agreed and dismissed the Attorney General of Canada’s  appeal. The Attorney General appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has dismissed the  Attorney General’s appeal.<strong> </strong><strong>The state may be required to pay damages for making  unconstitutional legislation if it is clearly unconstitutional, or was in bad  faith or an abuse of power.</strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice Wagner and Justice Karakatsanis held that the answer to both questions is  “yes”. The state is not entitled to an absolute immunity from liability for  damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes <em>Charter</em> rights. Rather, it may be liable  for <em>Charter </em>damages if the legislation is clearly unconstitutional or  was in bad faith or an abuse of power. An absolute immunity fails to properly  reconcile the constitutional principles that protect legislative autonomy, such  as parliamentary sovereignty and parliamentary privilege, and the principles  that require the government be held accountable for infringing <em>Charter</em> rights, such as  constitutionality and the rule of law. Each of these principles constitutes an  essential part of Canada’s constitutional law and they must all be respected to  achieve an appropriate separation of powers. By shielding the government from  liability in even the most egregious circumstances, absolute immunity would  subvert the principles that demand government accountability. "
2024 SCC 25,"<strong>The Supreme Court restores  a man’s acquittal because the trial judge committed no errors of law which  would allow the Crown to appeal</strong>This appeal addresses the circumstances in which the Crown can  appeal an acquittal, the accused’s state of mind (or <em>mens rea</em>) required for second degree murder, and the elements  required for self-defence. Mr. Hodgson attended a house party and was asked to help  with removing another guest who refused to leave despite repeated requests to  do so. A physical altercation ensued during which Mr. Hodgson used a chokehold  to restrain the guest, who lost consciousness and died. Mr. Hodgson was charged  with second degree murder.The trial judge found that it was proven beyond a  reasonable doubt that Mr. Hodgson caused the guest’s death by placing him in a  chokehold. However, based on her assessment of the evidence, she acquitted Mr.  Hodgson of second degree murder because the Crown failed to establish the  requisite subjective <em>mens rea. </em>A  second degree murder is a murder that is not planned and deliberate. She also  found Mr. Hodgson not guilty of manslaughter. Manslaughter refers to a homicide  committed as a result of a sudden provocation. The trial judge found that Mr.  Hodgson’s defence of self-defence under s. 34 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>had an air of reality and that the Crown had failed  to establish that the chokehold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal of the  acquittal and directed that a new trial be held on the basis that the trial  judge erred in law in her analysis of the <em>mens  rea</em> for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. Mr.  Hodgson appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and restored  the acquittal.<strong>The Crown’s right of appeal from an acquittal is limited to questions of  law alone.</strong>Writing jointly for the majority,  Justices Martin and Moreau noted that the Crown has a limited right of appeal  on questions of law alone when it seeks to overturn an acquittal. A question of  law is a question of legal interpretation that does not involve an evaluation  of the evidence. In this case, the Court of Appeal did not articulate the  precise errors of law at the root of its intervention and it is not a case in  which the appellate court could reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the  evidence without calling into question the trial judge’s evaluation of the  evidence. Furthermore, even if the alleged errors were ones of law, the trial  judge did not commit any such errors. Justices Martin and Moreau said  that an inference that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action is  available in some cases. However, it is not an error of law for a trial judge  to reach a different conclusion about a particular accused’s <em>mens rea</em> based on the evidence. The  Justices found there was no error of law in the trial judge’s assessment of the  evidence on the <em>mens rea</em>. As for self-defence, Justices  Martin and Moreau decided that the trial judge followed the framework set out  in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. That is to say,  the trial judge specifically addressed each of its three elements, correctly  stated the applicable statutory principles, applied them to the facts as found,  and expressed clear conclusions on each element."
2024 SCC 24,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that a taxpayer should not challenge tax  assessments by applying to the Federal Court for declarations.</strong>In this appeal, the  Supreme Court dealt with a question of jurisdiction. It determined whether a  taxpayer’s challenge to the validity of tax assessments was a matter within the  exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada or whether it could be brought  in the Federal Court. Iris Technologies  Inc. filed Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns claiming tax refunds under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> (“ETA”). The Minister of  National Revenue (the Minister) began an audit of the relevant reporting  periods and refused to pay the refunds while the audit was ongoing. The  Minister then issued an assessment denying the tax refund, and assessed  penalties to be paid by Iris. Iris asked the Federal  Court to review the Minister’s assessment. This kind of request is referred to  as an application for judicial review. Iris also asked the Federal Court to  declare (a) that the Minister failed to afford Iris procedural fairness in the  audit and an opportunity to respond to the proposed adjustments; (b) that the  assessments were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to the  findings of fact made by the Minister; and (c) that the assessments were made  for the improper purpose of seeking to deprive the Federal Court of  jurisdiction in a related application. The Attorney  General of Canada brought a motion to strike Iris’ application for judicial  review. The Case Management Judge dismissed the Attorney General’s motion. The  Attorney General appealed that decision to the Federal Court. The Federal Court  dismissed the Attorney General’s appeal, but the Federal Court of Appeal  allowed its subsequent appeal and struck out Iris’ application for judicial  review on the basis that it was, in essence, a collateral challenge to the  validity of the assessments, a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the  Tax Court. Iris appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The matter  should be brought in the Tax Court of Canada.</strong><strong> </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that notwithstanding the issuance of a tax  assessment, the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to conduct judicial  review over discretionary decisions delegated to the Minister by Parliament,  including those that directly affect liability. However, the Minister’s  assessment of net tax pursuant to the <em>ETA</em> is not the exercise of a discretionary power; it is a non-discretionary  determination where the outcome, the assessment, is dictated by statute. Jurisdiction  over the correctness of the assessment falls to the Tax Court under section 302  of the <em>ETA</em>. In the instant  case, two of the claims raised by Iris in its application for judicial review —  those alleging procedural unfairness and a lack of an evidentiary foundation —  are properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court as they are  best characterized as attacks on the correctness of the assessment. Iris’ third  claim, that the Minister acted with an improper purpose, could, in some  circumstances, be the basis for an application for judicial review, but should  be struck because Iris did not allege facts in its application that, if taken  to be true, would give any support to this claim. "
2024 SCC 23,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a taxpayer’s challenge to a discretionary decision by the Minister of  National Revenue should be brought in Federal Court. </strong>This appeal addressed  whether the Tax Court of Canada had jurisdiction to consider a company’s challenge  to a decision by the Minister of National Revenue. The Minister refused to reduce the company’s taxable income by adjusting the value of a  “non-arm’s length” transaction that the company had concluded with a foreign  lender. This procedure is called a downward transfer pricing adjustment. A “non-arm’s length”  transaction is one in which the parties are related to each other. They can  also be between unrelated individuals, partnerships or corporations, depending  on the circumstances. In contrast, an arm’s length transaction is one in which  both parties act in their separate interests. In the tax context, this  distinction is important because when evaluating a transaction between two  companies that are not at arm’s length, meaning they are associated in some  way, the revenue agency wants to ensure it is still collecting tax on the  transaction at the fair market value. The Canadian  company in question, Dow Chemical Canada ULC, concluded a non‑arm’s length  loan agreement to borrow money from a related Swiss company. As a result of  this loan agreement, Dow incurred interest expenses for its 2006 and 2007  taxation years. It also reported income for the 2006 taxation year in respect  of manufacturing services provided to the Swiss company. Following a review  of the transactions between Dow and the Swiss company, the Minister reassessed  Dow for its 2006 taxation year, applying transfer pricing rules set out in section  247(2) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> (“<em>ITA</em>”). Under section 247(2), where a  taxpayer is dealing with a non-resident person with whom it is not at arm’s  length – in this case, the Swiss company – the amounts in a given transaction  will be adjusted to reflect what would have been agreed to had the persons been  dealing with one another at arm’s length. The application of section 247(2)  resulted in a significant increase in Dow’s income in the 2006 taxation year,  meaning it would need to pay more tax on that income.Dow believed that  its income should be decreased. Where an amount is identified that would  decrease the taxpayer’s income, section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> says that a downward adjustment cannot be made unless approved  by the Minister. Dow asked the Minister to allow a downward transfer pricing  adjustment, but the Minister exercised her discretion to refuse Dow’s request. Dow then asked the  Federal Court to review the Minister’s decision. This process is called a  “judicial review”. Dow also objected to the reassessment for the 2006 taxation  year and eventually appealed the reassessment to the Tax Court.Dow’s appeal asked  whether the Minister’s denial of the request for a downward transfer pricing  adjustment fell outside the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Tax Court. The  Tax Court said that the Minister’s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is an essential component of the taxpayer’s assessment and goes to the  correctness of that assessment, and may therefore be reviewed by the Tax Court  under its exclusive jurisdiction to determine, on appeal, the correctness of  the assessment. The Minister disagreed and appealed to the Federal Court of  Appeal. The Federal Court  of Appeal allowed the Minister’s appeal and held that the Federal Court has  exclusive jurisdiction to conduct a judicial review of the Minister’s discretionary  decisions under section 247(10). Dow appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The Tax Court did not have jurisdiction to  review the Minister’s discretionary decision. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that when the Minister has exercised her  discretion under section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> to deny a taxpayer’s request for a downward pricing adjustment, that decision  falls outside of the jurisdiction of the Tax Court in respect of an appeal of  the taxpayer’s assessment. The Minister’s discretionary decision is not part of  the assessment. The meaning of “assessment” is settled in law, and the  Minister’s opinion formed under section 247(10) is qualitatively distinct from  that concept. As there is no express right of appeal to the Tax Court, the  proper forum to challenge the Minister’s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is the Federal Court, pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction in judicial review  under section 18(1) of the <em>Federal Courts  Act</em>. Only the Federal Court has the jurisdiction to apply the appropriate  standard of review and access to the appropriate range of administrative law  remedies."
2024 SCC 22,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules  that Ontario public school board teachers are protected from unreasonable  search and seizure in the workplace under the Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms.</strong>This appeal dealt with the  question of whether the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms </em>(the <em>Charter</em>)  applies to Ontario public school boards. Two teachers employed  by an Ontario public school board recorded their private communications  regarding workplace concerns on a shared personal, password-protected log stored  in the cloud. The school principal, who had been made aware of the log, entered the  classroom of one of the teachers to return some teaching materials after  classes had ended. The teacher was not present. The principal noticed that the Board laptop used by the teacher  was open and touched its mousepad. He saw the log that opened on the screen,  read what was visible, then scrolled through the document and took screenshots  with his cellphone. These communications then formed the basis for the school  board to issue written reprimands.   The teachers’ union filed a  grievance against the written reprimands issued to the teachers, claiming that  the search violated the teachers’ right to privacy at work. They did not allege  any breach of the <em>Charter</em>. A labour  arbitrator, appointed pursuant to the collective agreement, dismissed the  grievance. The arbitrator found there was no breach of the teachers’ reasonable  expectation of privacy when balanced against the school board’s interest in  managing the workplace.The teachers’ union asked the Divisional  Court to review the arbitrator’s decision. A majority of the Divisional Court held  that the arbitrator’s decision was reasonable. It said that the school  principal’s search did not raise any <em>Charter </em>issues because, unlike in a criminal context, an employee does not have the  right under section of the <em>Charter</em> to  be secure against unreasonable search or seizure in a workplace environment. The teachers’ union appealed to  the Ontario Court of Appeal, which unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed  the arbitrator’s decision. It held that the majority of the Divisional Court made  a mistake in concluding that section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> did not apply. The Court of Appeal held that  school boards are subject to the <em>Charter</em> and that the school principal’s search was unreasonable under section 8. The school  board then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The  Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The <em>Charter </em>applies to Ontario public  school boards. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Rowe said Ontario public school board teachers are protected by section 8 of  the <em>Charter</em> in the workplace, as  these boards are inherently governmental for the purposes of section 32 of the <em>Charter</em>. Section 32 identifies certain  entities that are bound by the <em>Charter</em>,  including federal and provincial legislatures and governments, as well as  entities that are controlled by a government or that perform governmental  functions. Consequently, the grievance at issue implicated an alleged violation  of a <em>Charter </em>right, and section 8 of  the<em> Charter</em> was a legal constraint  bearing on the arbitrator’s analysis. On review, applying the correctness  standard, the arbitrator erred by limiting her inquiry to the arbitral  framework without regard for the legal framework under section that, as a  matter of law, she was required to respect. This error was fatal and the  arbitrator’s decision should be set aside. For these reasons, Justice Rowe dismissed  the appeal. "
2024 SCC 21,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that no secret trial  was held in a case involving a person with police informer status.</strong>A person who acted as an informer  for a police force was charged with criminal offences. The person brought a  motion for a stay of proceedings based in part on abusive state conduct related  to the laying of the charges. Because the person’s informer status was at the  centre of the relevant factual context and the parties’ arguments, the judge  dealing with the motion ordered that it be heard <em>in camera</em>, that is, in private. No notice was given to the  media, since the judge was of the view that revealing anything about the  motion, including its existence, would be likely to compromise the person’s  anonymity. The motion, its content and the exhibits and transcripts submitted  to the judge remained confidential and were not in any court record. The motion  was dismissed in a written judgment, which had no file number and could not be  consulted by the public.The person was subsequently  convicted and appealed the conviction. The appeal was heard <em>in camera</em>, and no notice was given  to the media. The Court of Appeal allowed the person’s appeal, stayed the  conviction and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground of  abuse of process by the state. The Court of Appeal decided to open a record at its  court office, accompanied by a sealing order, and to make public a version of  its decision in which certain information was redacted, that is, blacked out.  In that decision, the Court of Appeal denounced the holding of a “secret  trial”, which alarmed the public and the media. It also expressed its  disagreement with the scope of the confidentiality measures put in place for  the person’s trial.A number of media organizations,  the Attorney General of Quebec and the Chief Judge of the Court of Québec then  asked the Court of Appeal to review the confidentiality orders made in this  case. In a second decision, the Court of Appeal upheld the sealing of all  information that might tend to identify the person. The Court of Appeal also  refused to partially unseal, or open up, the appeal record by redacting the  same information as in the public version of its decision. The media  organizations and the Attorney General of Quebec appealed that second decision  to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has allowed  their appeals in part.<strong>Court openness is a cardinal principle of the Canadian justice system. Any exception to this principle must be limited.</strong>In a unanimous judgment, the  Court confirmed that no secret trial was held in this case. The Court in fact specified  that “the very concept of ‘secret trial’ does not exist in Canada. . . .  [T]he  cardinal principle of court openness may be tempered where the circumstances of  a case so require. Various confidentiality orders may be made . . .,  up to and including an order that all hearings be held <em>in camera</em> . . . But it is well established that  ‘secret trials’, those that leave no trace, are not part of the range of  possible measures.” According to the Supreme Court,  the magnitude of the controversy that arose after the Court of Appeal’s first decision  was released could have been limited if that court had not used the expression  “secret trial” to describe what were actually <em>in camera</em> hearings held in a proceeding that began and  initially moved forward publicly.Where, as in this case, an informer asserts their status in a proceeding  that began publicly in which they face charges that do not cause them to lose  their status, and the informer‑police relationship is central to the  proceedings, the appropriate way to protect the informer’s anonymity will  generally be to proceed totally <em>in camera</em>.  Even in these most confidential of cases, it is still possible — and even  essential — to protect the informer’s anonymity while favouring confidentiality  orders that do not entirely or indefinitely keep the existence of a hearing or  judgment from the public. What is in issue is the maintenance of public  confidence in the administration of justice and compliance with the guiding  rule from <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2384/index.do"">Named  Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43</a></em>, which requires a court to protect informer  privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open  court principle.As the Supreme Court noted, when  justice is rendered in secret, without leaving any trace, respect for the rule  of law is jeopardized and public confidence in the administration of justice  may be shaken. The open court principle allows a society to guard against such  risks, which erode the very foundations of democracy. By ensuring the  accountability of the judiciary, court openness supports an administration of  justice that is impartial, fair and in accordance with the rule of law. It also  helps the public gain a better understanding of the justice system and its  participants, which can only enhance public confidence in their integrity.  Court openness is therefore of paramount importance to our democracy — an  importance that is also reflected in the constitutional protection afforded to  it in Canada. In this case, the Supreme Court found  that the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the motions for disclosure of  the information that had been kept confidential up to that time but that it erred  in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. The case is  therefore remanded to the Court of Appeal so that it can make public a redacted  version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting  the parties concerned on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction."
2024 SCC 20,"<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies what is required for an exclusion  clause in a contract of sale to exempt the seller from an implied condition  under Ontario’s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. </strong>This appeal concerned a party’s ability to contract out of an  implied condition of sale under Ontario’s <em>Sale  of Goods Act</em>. Implied conditions are obligations that are automatically  incorporated into a contract unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. The  Supreme Court clarified what was required to show that the parties expressly  agreed to contract out of the implied condition.   Pine Valley  Enterprises Inc. was hired by the City of Toronto to work on a municipal  project to remediate flooding, which included the removal and replacement of  topsoil for drainage. Pine Valley contacted Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc., a  topsoil provider, to obtain topsoil with a specified composition. Earthco provided  Pine Valley with laboratory reports from different topsoil samples taken about  six weeks prior, and warned against purchasing the topsoil without updated test  results.  However, Pine Valley had  already missed project deadlines and urgently wanted delivery of the topsoil to  avoid a financial penalty. Pine Valley therefore insisted on immediate  delivery. Pine Valley and Earthco agreed to add two exclusion clauses to their  contract that stated that Pine Valley had the right to test and approve the  material before it was shipped, and that if it waived those rights, Earthco  would not be responsible for the quality of the material once it left its  facility. After the  topsoil was delivered and placed on the project site, water ponding was noted. New  testing revealed that there was substantially more clay in the topsoil than the  initial test results had indicated, and Pine Valley had to remove and replace  the topsoil. Pine Valley then sued Earthco for damages, alleging that it did  not receive topsoil within the range of compositional properties that had been  indicated in the initial test results.The trial judge  dismissed Pine Valley’s action. He found that the contract was for a sale of  goods by description within the meaning of section 14 of Ontario’s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which sets out an  implied condition that goods must correspond with their description. He agreed  that Pine Valley did not get the topsoil it bargained for, because of the  variation between the topsoil that was promised and the topsoil that was  delivered. However, the trial judge concluded that the exclusion clauses met  the requirements of an “express agreement” according to section 53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which allows parties to  contract out of the implied condition under section 14. He concluded as such  despite the fact that the exclusion clauses did not explicitly mention that  they were added to the contract for this purpose.  The Court of  Appeal disagreed with the trial judge and found that the wording in the  exclusion clauses was insufficient to exempt Earthco from liability under section  14 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. The  Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a judgment requiring Earthco  to pay damages. Earthco appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal.<strong>The exclusion clauses were an express agreement  pursuant to section 53. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin said that to be sufficient for the purposes of section  53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, an  “express agreement” must be comprised of an agreement to negative or vary a  statutorily implied right, duty or liability and such an agreement must be  expressly set forth within the parties’ contract. The determination as to what  qualifies as an express agreement must also be informed by principles of  contractual interpretation and the law concerning exclusion clauses, and the  paramount consideration must be the objective intention of the parties. In the instant  case, the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion  clauses at issue. The objective meaning of the parties’ express agreement was that  Pine Valley accepted the risk that the topsoil would not meet the previously  supplied specifications concerning its composition if it failed to test what it  knew was an organic and changing substance. For these reasons, Justice Martin  allowed the appeal and restored the trial judge’s judgment. "
2024 SCC 19,"<strong>The Supreme Court says a trial court was right to refuse evidence of  prior sexual activity in a sexual assault case.   </strong>The accused was convicted of a sexual assault that  took place on April 2, 2018. The complainant was his spouse, who testified that  her marriage to the accused had completely broken down in February of that  year. However, in an earlier statement to the police, the complainant also  stated that she and the accused had engaged in consensual sexual activity on  the evening of April 1, the night before the sexual assault. Prior to his trial, the accused asked the court to  allow evidence that he and the complainant had engaged in consensual sexual  activity in the evening of April 1 and in the morning of April 2. He argued  that admitting such evidence would serve to challenge the complainant’s  credibility – specifically with respect to her claim that the marriage had  completely broken down at the time of the alleged assault – to provide context,  and to support his defence that the complainant had consented to the sexual  activity, as it was all part of one interaction. Under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, evidence of a complainant’s sexual activity with the  accused or with any other person is not admissible to support an inference that  the complainant is either (a) more likely to have consented to the sexual  activity at the center of the charge; or (b) is less worthy of belief. In law,  this is called “twin-myth reasoning” and relying on such inferences is not  allowed.The trial judge dismissed the accused’s application to  admit this evidence. He found no inconsistency between the complainant’s  statement to the police and her testimony. In his view, the evidence the accused  wanted to submit was irrelevant to her credibility – it would only serve to  support one of the two inferences prohibited under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. As required under section  278.95 of the <em>Criminal </em>Code, the  content of the accused’s application, the hearing that was held to decide the  issue and the trial judge’s decision were subject to a publication ban. The  case went to trial and the accused was ultimately convicted. The accused’s appeal proceeded <em>in camera </em>(closed to the public) and the appeal record was sealed  (not made public). A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia  dismissed the accused’s appeal. It agreed with the trial judge that the accused  had not identified a legitimate use of the proposed evidence. The accused then appealed the decision to the Supreme  Court of Canada. By way of a motion, the Crown relied on section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to ask the Court for an <em>in camera </em>hearing, for filed materials  to be sealed, and for any other order necessary to protect information and  evidence related to the accused’s application to admit evidence on prior sexual  activity. The Court heard oral arguments on the motion before continuing with  the hearing on the appeal. The Supreme Court has dismissed the accused’s appeal  and allowed the Crown’s motion in part.   <strong>The evidence of prior sexual activity was inadmissible at the trial.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice O’Bonsawin held that the accused failed to  sufficiently identify a specific use for the prior sexual activity evidence  that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and that was essential to his ability  to make full answer and defence. The trial judge did not make a mistake in  denying the application. As such, the accused’s conviction was upheld. With respect to the Crown’s motion, Justice O’Bonsawin determined  that the mandatory publication ban under section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>did not extend to  appellate proceedings. Rather, she said the Supreme Court’s power to make an  order limiting court openness in the instant case was derived from implied  jurisdiction of courts to control their own processes and records. The Court’s  discretion should be exercised in a way that maintains court openness as far as  practicable while protecting the complainant’s personal dignity and privacy and  the accused’s fair trial rights.Justice O’Bonsawin then applied the test set out in <a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2021/38695-eng.pdf""><em>Sherman Estate v. Donovan</em></a>, a prior unrelated  decision of this Court, to conclude that the circumstances of the instant case  did not justify all of the measures requested by the Crown. Banning publication  of any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity  other than that which formed the subject-matter of the charge was  sufficient.     "
2024 SCC 18,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  the convictions of two men guilty of manslaughter.</strong>The issue in these appeals  was whether the trial judge made a mistake in instructing the jury on how to  establish causation between the accused’s unlawful acts and the victim’s death from  stabbing wounds inflicted by a third person. Emanuel Lozada and Victor  Ramos were accused of manslaughter as a result of an unlawful act (known in law  as “unlawful act manslaughter”) after participating in a fight in downtown  Toronto, which resulted in the fatal stabbing of a victim. It was never  suggested that either Mr. Lozada or Mr. Ramos had stabbed the victim. A third person  was convicted of second degree murder for the stabbing. Rather, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos were accused of acting as co-principals in the fatal attack or aiders  and abettors to the stabber. To convict Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos, the Crown needed to establish causation between their unlawful acts –  their participation in the group assault – and the victim’s death. To do so,  the Crown had to prove that the unlawful acts were a significant contributing  cause to his death. The Crown’s theory was that Mr. Ramos fought with the  victim and punched or kicked him, while Mr. Lozada fought with one of the  victim’s friends. It argued that the two men’s assaults left the victim  vulnerable to being stabbed by the third man. In their defence, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos argued that the stabbing was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence  of their decision to join a fight. As such, the stabbing event broke the chain  of causation between their assaults and the victim’s death and they could not  be held criminally responsible for it. The jury convicted Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos of unlawful act manslaughter. The two men appealed their  convictions together at the Ontario Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial  judge made a mistake when instructing the jury on whether their conduct was a  significant contributing cause of the victim’s death. The majority of the Court  of Appeal dismissed their appeals. It found that when considered in isolation,  two passages from the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on reasonable  foreseeability misstated the law. However, the majority concluded that read as  a whole, the instructions given by the trial judge to the jury were accurate. Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeals.<strong>The jury was accurately instructed on the issue of causation.</strong>Writing for the majority,  Justice Moreau said that on a reading of the jury instructions and the trial  judge’s answers to the jury’s questions as a whole, the instructions conveyed  the proper test for causation: whether the conduct of Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos  was a significant contributing cause of the victim’s death. Moreover, the trial  judge properly equipped the jury with appropriate analytical tools – i.e. the  question of reasonable foreseeability – to assist the jury in determining  whether the stabbing could be considered to be an intervening act that would  absolve Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos of legal responsibility for manslaughter. For  these reasons, Justice Moreau dismissed the appeals and upheld the manslaughter  convictions.  "
2024 SCC 17,"<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies  how zoning regulations and other restrictions on land use affect how owners of  expropriated property are compensated.  </strong>Expropriation is a forcible acquisition by the Crown  of privately-owned property for public purposes. A “constructive expropriation”  happens when a public authority acquires private property by using its  regulatory powers. In such cases, the owners can be entitled to compensation  based on the property’s market value. At issue in this case was the Lynch family’s property  in the Broad Cove River watershed in Newfoundland. Groundwater within the  watershed drains towards the Broad Cove River, which is used by the City of St.  John’s for the local water supply. Pursuant to the <em>City of St. John’s Act</em>, the Lynch property is subject to the City’s  pollution control and expropriation powers. In 1994, the Lynch property was  zoned as watershed (the “watershed zoning”). Within the watershed zone, the  City’s permission is required for any use of the land, and it may only be  granted for three discretionary uses: agriculture, forestry and public utility. Since at least the 1990s, the Lynch family has tried  to obtain permission to develop the property. In 2013, the City rejected a  formal application to develop a residential subdivision on the property, citing  its authority under the <em>City of St.  John’s Act </em>and the property’s designation as part of the watershed zone. Following  that refusal, the Lynch family turned to the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of  Appeal, which declared that the City had expropriated the Lynch property when it  refused to permit any development on it. The court’s decision meant that the  Lynch family was entitled to compensation from the City. The City asked the Board of Commissioners of Public  Utilities to assess how much the Lynch family was owed. In turn, the Board  sought the opinion of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador to  determine whether compensation should be assessed based on the watershed zoning  or whether the watershed zoning should be ignored and the value determined as  if residential development were allowed. This question was important because  valuation according to the watershed zoning would diminish the market value of  the property compared to the Lynch family’s desire to use it for residential  development. As a result, taking the watershed zoning into account would reduce  the compensation owed to the Lynch family.The judge applied a legal principle according to which  changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are ignored in  the compensation assessment. As such, the question became whether the watershed  zoning was made with a view to expropriating the Lynch property. The judge ruled  that the watershed zoning was an independent enactment and not part of the  expropriation scheme. This meant that it could operate to influence the market  value of the Lynch property and was not to be ignored for the purpose of  determining compensation. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal allowed  the Lynch family’s appeal. It disagreed with the first judge and concluded that  the watershed zoning was connected to the expropriation. As such, it ordered  the Board to determine compensation without reference to the watershed zoning. The  City appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.  <strong>The watershed  zoning was independent from the expropriation scheme. </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Martin held  that the Lynch family was entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair  compensation for the City’s constructive expropriation of the property. She  agreed with the first judge’s finding that the watershed zoning was an  independent enactment and not made with a view to expropriation. As such,  Justice Martin determined that the market value assessment for the property  must take into account the fact that the watershed zoning limits use of the  property to discretionary agriculture, forestry and public utility. To ignore  the watershed zoning would compensate the Lynch family for something they never  would have had absent the expropriation: unencumbered land to develop  residential housing. For these reasons, Justice Martin allowed the appeal, set  aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restored the first judge’s order. "
2024 SCC 16,"<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial in French for an accused person who was not informed  of his right to be tried in the official language of his choice.  </strong>This case was about the  analytical framework that a court of appeal must apply when an accused person appeals  their conviction because they were not informed of their right to be tried in  the official language of their choice the first time they appeared before a  judge, where no decision on their language rights was made at first instance.Section 530 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>guarantees to every  accused person the right to be tried in the official language of their choice. To  make certain that the accused’s choice is free and informed, section 530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> imposes a duty on the  judge before whom the accused first appears to ensure that the accused is  advised of their right and of the time before which they must apply for a trial  before a judge or a judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official  language of their choice.Franck Yvan Tayo Tompouba is a  bilingual Francophone who was convicted of sexual assault following a trial  conducted in English in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. During the  judicial process leading to Mr. Tayo Tompouba’s conviction, the judge did  not ensure that he was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to  the requirements of section 530(3) of the <em>Code</em>. Mr. Tayo Tompouba did not apply for a trial in French or  raise the breach of his right to be advised of his right to make such an  application.Mr. Tayo Tompouba appealed  his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. It was then that he asserted  for the first time that he would have liked his trial to be conducted in French.  Mr. Tayo Tompouba alleged that his language rights had been violated due,  among other things, to the fact that the judge had breached his duty under  section 530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed his  appeal. While it was of the view that the judge’s breach was an error of law  that warranted its intervention, it found that the evidence did not make it  possible to decide certain key questions, including when Mr. Tayo Tompouba  had learned of his fundamental right, whether he would in fact have chosen a  trial in French if he had had an opportunity to do so, and whether he had not  made a free and informed choice to have a trial in English. It therefore found  that the evidence was insufficient and that Mr. Tayo Tompouba had not met  the burden of persuading it that the judge’s breach of the duty set out in section 530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> had resulted in a violation  of his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. Mr. Tayo Tompouba appealed  the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, which has allowed his appeal.<strong>The Court of Appeal erred in imposing on Mr. Tayo Tompouba the  burden of proving that his fundamental right had been violated at first  instance.  </strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice Wagner stated that section 530(3) imposes a two‑pronged  informational duty on the judge before whom an accused first appears: to ensure  that the accused is duly informed of their fundamental right and of how it is  to be exercised, and, where the circumstances so require, to take the necessary  steps to inform the accused of this.  Chief Justice Wagner affirmed that a breach of this informational duty is an  error of law warranting appellate intervention under section 686(1)(a) of  the <em>Code</em>. As he explained, this  breach, once established, taints the trial court’s judgment and gives rise to a  presumption that the accused’s fundamental right to be tried in the official  language of their choice, which is guaranteed to the accused by section 530  of the <em>Code</em>, was violated. The Crown  can then rebut this presumption for the purposes of the analysis under the  curative proviso in section 686(1)(b)(iv) of the <em>Code</em>, which allows a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal where an  error or irregularity shown by the accused did not cause them any prejudice.In this case,  Chief Justice Wagner concluded, first, that Mr. Tayo Tompouba had  proved that an error reviewable on appeal had been made and, second, that the  Crown had failed to establish that Mr. Tayo Tompouba’s fundamental right had  not in fact been violated despite the judge’s breach of his informational duty  under section 530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.  For these reasons, Chief Justice Wagner allowed the appeal, quashed Mr. Tayo  Tompouba’s conviction and ordered that a new trial be held in French."
2024 SCC 15,"<strong>The Supreme Court holds  that the military status of military judges does not violate the constitutional  guarantee of judicial independence to which persons tried before courts martial  are entitled. </strong>These appeals are about whether the requirement under  the <em>National Defence Act</em> that military  judges be military officers violates the right to a hearing by an independent  and impartial tribunal guaranteed under Section 11(d) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.   The appeals were brought by nine members of the  Canadian Armed Forces who were accused of various service offences under the  Code of Service Discipline, which forms part of the <em>National Defence Act</em>. Service offences, which include offences  specific to military personnel and offences under the <em>Criminal Code </em>and other Canadian laws, are tried before a court  martial, a military court that has the same powers, rights, and privileges as a  superior court of criminal jurisdiction. Courts martial are presided over by  military judges, who are required by the <em>National  Defence Act </em>to have been lawyers and military officers for at least 10  years. As officers, military judges are part of the chain of command.     In the courts martial, most of the nine accused members  challenged the requirement under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>that the military judges presiding over their courts martial be  officers. They argued that this requirement violates their right to a hearing  by an independent and impartial tribunal under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. The divided loyalties of  military judges as judge and officer were said to deflect them from a proper  exercise of their judicial duties and leaves them vulnerable to pressures from  the chain of command.Under Canadian law, courts must evaluate independence  and impartiality under Section 11(d) by asking whether an informed and  reasonable person would perceive the tribunal at issue as independent. In the  courts martial, some of the military judges held that they lacked judicial  independence because of their dual status of judge and officer, and that for  this reason, the accused members’ Section 11(d) rights were infringed. The  Court Martial Appeal Court disagreed, and said that an informed person, viewing  the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through,  would conclude that military judges are sufficiently impartial and independent  to meet the requirement under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter. </em>Therefore, the accused members’ rights were not infringed.  The accused members appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.     The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. <strong>The status of  military judges as officers under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>is not incompatible with their judicial functions for the  purpose of Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Kasirer affirmed  that accused members of the Canadian Armed Forces who appear before military  judges are entitled to the same guarantee of judicial independence and  impartiality under Section 11(d) as accused persons who appear before civilian  criminal courts, but this does not require that the two systems be identical in  every respect. He held that as presently configured in the <em>National Defence Act</em>, Canada’s system of military justice fully  ensures judicial independence for military judges in a way that takes account  of the military context, and specifically of the legislative policies of  maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the forces and public trust in  a disciplined armed forces. Justice Kasirer concluded that properly understood,  the military context does not diminish judicial independence. "
2024 SCC 14,"<strong>The Supreme Court restores  the convictions of a man found guilty of sexual assault and sexual  interference. </strong>This appeal dealt with the  question of whether a judge in a criminal trial made a mistake in understanding  and treating key parts of the complainant’s evidence in a manner that led him  to unfairly convict the accused. In legal terms, this is called  “misapprehending” the evidence. D.F., whose name cannot be  disclosed due to a publication ban protecting the complainant, was accused of  sexual assault, sexual interference (meaning touching someone under the age of  16 for a sexual purpose), and of making sexually explicit material available to  a child. The complainant was eight years old at the time of the alleged  offences. The offences allegedly took place while the accused was spending the  day and evening at the house of the complainant’s mother. The mother testified  that she had been at the house all day and evening except when she briefly stepped  out to a nearby store after dinner. D.F. stayed behind during that time with the  complainant and her two younger siblings. At trial, there were some  inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony under cross-examination  regarding whether or not her mother was home when the alleged sexual touching  happened. However, the trial judge held that any minor inconsistencies in her  testimony were a result of the complainant’s immaturity and confusion, and that  she was otherwise credible and reliable. The trial judge also found the other  witnesses credible and reliable, including the complainant’s mother, who  testified that except for her trip to the store, she had been around the  children all evening and did not observe any wrongdoing. Based on the evidence  as a whole, including the testimonies, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a  reasonable doubt of D.F.’s guilt and convicted him.   D.F. appealed his  convictions. A majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal  from the conviction on the count of making sexually explicit material available  to a child, but allowed the appeal from his other two convictions. In the  majority’s view, the trial judge misapprehended the complainant’s evidence on  whether or not the complainant’s mother was home at the time of the alleged  sexual touching. That mistake was related to an important issue at trial, and played  an essential role in the trial judge’s reasoning process leading to convicting  D.F. Moreover, the majority said that the trial judge did not sufficiently  address the inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence and that of her  mother in his decision to convict. For these reasons, the majority ordered that  the convictions for sexual assault and sexual interference be set aside and that  a new trial be held on those counts.    One judge disagreed and  would have dismissed D.F.’s appeal in its entirety. In his view, the trial  judge did not make any errors in assessing the evidence. The trial judge  recognized that the complainant’s evidence regarding the location of her mother  at the time of the offences was inconsistent but he had not relied on it to convict  D.F. Rather, the trial judge had correctly applied a common sense approach to  assessing evidence of child witnesses to determine she was a credible and  reliable witness overall. Finally, the dissenting judge determined that the  trial judge’s reasons sufficiently explained why he was satisfied beyond a  reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offences.  The Crown appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.  <strong>The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.  </strong>As such, D.F.’s convictions  for sexual assault and sexual interference are restored.

2024 SCC 12,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an Indigenous tribe’s treaty  land entitlement claim is statute-barred, but that declaratory relief is  warranted given the longevity and magnitude of the Crown’s dishonorable  conduct.</strong>This appeal is about whether the breach of an Indigenous tribe’s  treaty land entitlement was actionable in Canadian courts before the coming  into force of section 35(1) of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1982</em>, which recognized and affirmed the existing Aboriginal and treaty  rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.<strong></strong>The Blood Tribe are a member tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy of  First Nations. In 1877, Treaty No. 7 was made between the Crown and the  Confederacy. Treaty No. 7 established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148, the largest  reserve in Canada and the home of the Blood Tribe. The reserve’s size was to be  set by the treaty land entitlement (“TLE”) provisions, based on a formula  promising one square mile for each family of five persons, or in that  proportion for larger and smaller families.The Blood Tribe has long claimed  that the size of the reserve did not respect the TLE formula. In 1971, a Blackfoot  researcher gathered information on the total number of people in the Blood  Tribe for the years 1879 to 1884 and, based on this information, confirmed that  the existing reserve boundaries did not match the boundaries owed under the TLE  formula. The Blood Tribe formally sought to negotiate with the Minister of  Indian Affairs, who rejected its claims. In 1980, the Chief at the time, Jim Shot Both Sides, commenced an  action together with others on behalf of the Blood Tribe in the Federal Court.  They alleged breaches of the Crown’s fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment,  and negligence, and sought declaratory relief and damages for breach of  contract arising from the Crown’s failure to fulfil the TLE according to the  prescribed formula (the “TLE Claim”). Declaratory relief is a determination of  a party’s rights without other consequences.The trial judge dismissed all  claims except the TLE Claim, concluding that the Crown had miscalculated the  size of the reserve by underestimating the Blood Tribe’s membership, and stated  that the Crown’s conduct during the reserve’s creation was unconscionable. The  trial judge found that although the facts underlying the TLE Claim were  discoverable in 1971 or shortly thereafter, the applicable six-year limitation  period did not begin to run until 1982, when the enactment of section 35(1) of  the Constitution Act, 1982 created a new cause of action for treaty breaches. The  remedies sought for the TLE Claim were therefore not statute-barred because the  action was commenced in 1980. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and held that  the TLE Claim was statute-barred. In its view, section 35(1) did not create new  treaty rights, and a remedy was available for the TLE Claim prior to 1982  regardless of the framed cause of action. The Blood Tribe appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part and issued declaratory  relief.<strong>Section 35(1) of the  Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach of treaty  rights.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice O’Bonsawin explained that section  35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach  of treaty rights. Treaty rights flow from the treaty, not the Constitution, and  treaties are enforceable upon execution and give rise to actionable duties  under the common law. Accordingly, the Blood Tribe’s TLE Claim was enforceable  at common law and actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1).  The Blood Tribe did not contest the trial judge’s finding that the TLE Claim  was discoverable as early as 1971 or that the action was not commenced until  1980. As such, the TLE Claim is statute-barred by operation of the applicable  six-year limitation period.However, Justice O’Bonsawin concluded that declaratory  relief is warranted in this case given the longevity and magnitude of the  Crown’s dishonorable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. She wrote, “[it] will  serve an important role in clarifying the Blood Tribe’s TLE, identifying the  Crown’s dishonourable conduct, assisting future reconciliation efforts, and  helping to restore the honour of the Crown.”"
2024 SCC 11,"<strong>The Supreme  Court confirms that a Canadian bank must refuse payment to the beneficiary of a  letter of credit due to fraud. </strong>In this appeal, the Court addressed  the issue of whether a Canadian bank was required to refuse payment to the  beneficiary of a letter of credit because of a third party’s fraudulent  behaviour, which was attributable to the beneficiary. In 1998, Bombardier Inc., a  Canadian aviation company based in Montreal, concluded a procurement contract  with the Hellenic Ministry of Defence (HMOD) in Greece for the sale of 10  firefighting airplanes. They also concluded a second contract pursuant to which  Bombardier agreed to subcontract some of the work associated with the airplane procurement  to Greek companies. That contract said that if, at the end of a 10-year term,  Bombardier did not fulfil its subcontracting obligation, it would owe HMOD a  certain amount of money relative to the main contract. To secure payment of the money  Bombardier might owe HMOD under the second contract, the Greek bank at the time  (now Eurobank Ergasias S.A., or, Eurobank) issued a letter of credit guaranteeing  that Eurobank would pay if Bombardier did not (the Letter of Guarantee). For  its part, Eurobank obtained a letter of credit from the National Bank of Canada  to secure a reimbursement in the amount that it would need to pay HMOD under  the Letter of Guarantee if the latter claimed that Bombardier failed to perform  its obligations under the second contract (the Letter of Counter-Guarantee). In  short, the letters would work as follows: if HMOD asked Eurobank to honour the  Letter of Guarantee, Eurobank would then be entitled to turn to the National  Bank to reimburse it under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.A dispute eventually arose  between HMOD and Bombardier with respect to the latter’s subcontracting  obligations. HMOD demanded payment from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee.  In response, Bombardier asked the Superior Court of Québec for an order to stop  the National Bank from honouring a subsequent demand for repayment by Eurobank  under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier alleged that HMOD, a third  party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, committed fraud by demanding payment  before the dispute was resolved by the planned arbitration procedure and that,  because of Eurobank’s knowledge and participation in the fraud, the National  Bank should be prevented from needing to repay Eurobank on the basis of the  “fraud exception”. Under Canadian law, banks have a nearly absolute obligation to  pay the beneficiary of a letter of credit when a valid  demand is made, except when the  beneficiary has committed fraud and it is brought to the bank’s attention  before payment. In this case, Bombardier argued that given HMOD’s fraudulent  conduct, Eurobank’s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was,  by extension, also fraudulent. The Superior Court rejected  Eurobank’s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee on the  basis of the fraud exception. It held that the manner in which HMOD obtained  payment under the Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent, and that Eurobank’s own  conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of  which it was aware. It therefore concluded the National Bank was not required  to repay Eurobank. A majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal agreed and  dismissed the appeal. Eurobank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal.  <strong>The fraud exception applies with respect to Eurobank’s demand for  payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Kasirer explained that because Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud committed by HMOD, that  fraud could be attributed to it as though it was its own. The requirement that  there be fraud by the beneficiary to apply the fraud exception was therefore  met. Moreover, there was no question that Eurobank’s fraud was brought to the  attention of the National Bank as the insurer of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee. On that basis, Justice Kasirer concluded that the National  Bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under  the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank and the majority of the Court of  Appeal made no mistake in that conclusion."
2024 SCC 10,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds a First Nation’s  requirement that its leaders must live on its traditional territory. </strong>This appeal dealt with the question of whether the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>applied  to an election rule enacted by a self-governing First Nation in the Yukon. It  also addressed whether that rule unjustifiably infringed a member’s right to  equality under Section 15 of the <em>Charter</em>.  To answer the second question, the Supreme Court needed to determine whether upholding  the individual’s equality right “abrogated” or “derogated from” (in other  words, abolished or diminished) a protected Aboriginal, treaty or other right or  freedom belonging to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, as stated under Section  25 of the <em>Charter</em>.  The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (“VGFN”) is a self-governing  Indigenous community in the Yukon. Its seat of government is based in Old Crow,  a village located about 800 kilometers north of Whitehorse in the traditional  territory of the Vuntut Gwitchin and constituting the VGFN’s main community in its settlement  land. VGFN has its own Constitution, as well as  electoral rules and standards. One of these rules requires that the elected  Chief and Councillors reside on the settlement land of the First Nation, or  relocate there within 14 days of their election.Cindy Dickson is a member of the VGFN and a citizen of Canada. She  lives in Whitehorse and is constrained for personal reasons to stay there. She wanted  to stand for election as a Councillor of VGFN and said that the residency  requirement discriminated against her as a non-resident of the settlement land.  She challenged the residency requirement before the Yukon Supreme Court,  arguing that it violated her right to equality guaranteed under Section 15(1)  of the <em>Charter</em>.       In response, the VGFN relied on Section 32(1) of the <em>Charter</em>, which identifies certain  entities that are bound by it, including federal and provincial legislatures  and governments, as well as entities that are controlled by a government or  that perform governmental functions. As a self-governing Indigenous community,  the VGFN said that it did not fit the definition and scope of a “government”  under Section 32(1), and therefore, was not bound by the <em>Charter</em>. As such, the residency requirement fell outside the <em>Charter</em>’s application. Alternatively, the VGFN argued that if it were bound by the <em>Charter</em>, the residency requirement did  not violate Ms. Dickson’s right to equality, and, even if it did, the  requirement was protected by Section 25 of the <em>Charter</em>. Section 25 states that the guarantee in the <em>Charter </em>of certain rights and freedoms must  not be interpreted so as to abrogate or derogate from any Aboriginal, treaty or  other rights or freedoms that belong to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada. According  to the VGFN, the residency requirement protected collective minority rights  relating to its traditional Indigenous modes of government and leadership. As  such, it could not be defeated by Ms. Dickson’s individual <em>Charter </em>right. The Yukon Supreme Court agreed that the <em>Charter </em>applied to the VGFN, but that if the residency requirement  infringed Ms. Dickson’s equality right, it was still protected by Section 25 of  the <em>Charter</em>. As a result, Ms.  Dickson’s challenge was rejected. The Yukon Court of Appeal also agreed. Ms.  Dickson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada on the question of the  constitutional validity of the residency requirement, and the VGFN cross-appealed  on the question of the application of the <em>Charter</em>.   The Supreme Court has dismissed Ms. Dickson’s appeal and the VGFN’s cross-appeal. <strong>The residency requirement  is protected as an “other” right or freedom under section 25 of the <em>Charter </em>because it preserves “Indigenous  difference”.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal held  that the <em>Charter</em> applied to the VGFN,  but Ms. Dickson’s Section 15 <em>Charter </em>challenge  failed and the residency requirement was upheld, because of the operation of  Section 25.The <em>Charter </em>applied to the  VGFN, principally because it is a government by nature pursuant to Section  32(1). Furthermore, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal determined that Ms.  Dickson had succeeded in showing that the residency requirement constituted a <em>prima facie </em>(or, on its face) infringement  of her right to equality under Section 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>. However, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal said that the residency  requirement was an exercise of an “other” right or freedom that pertains to the  Aboriginal peoples of Canada under Section 25 of the <em>Charter</em>. As they explained, the purpose of Section 25 is to uphold  certain collective rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples when those  collective rights conflict with an individual’s <em>Charter </em>rights. They declared that the residency requirement  protects “Indigenous difference”, understood as interests connected to  Aboriginal cultural difference, Aboriginal prior occupancy, Aboriginal prior  sovereignty, or Aboriginal participation in the treaty process. “Requiring VGFN  leaders to reside on settlement land helps preserve the leaders’ connection to  the land, which is deeply rooted in the VGFN’s distinctive culture and  governance practices. It also bolsters the VGFN’s ability to resist the outside  forces that pull citizens away from its settlement land […]. Such interests are  associated with various aspects of Indigenous difference . . .”Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal concluded that Ms. Dickson’s claim  based on her Section 15 right to equality abrogated or derogated from this “other”  right under Section 25, which created an irreconcilable conflict between the  two. As such, pursuant to Section 25 of the <em>Charter</em>,  her claim could not be given effect."
2024 SCC 9,"<strong>The Supreme  Court upholds a man’s conviction for dangerous driving causing bodily harm.</strong>The  issue in the appeal was whether a judge presiding over a dangerous driving  trial rendered an unreasonable decision on the basis of inferences that were  illogical and clearly contradicted by the evidence. Gabriel  Boudreau was convicted of dangerous driving causing bodily harm as a result of  a collision between his vehicle and the complainant’s on a Québec City highway  in 2017. Mr. Boudreau’s vehicle rear‑ended the complainant’s vehicle. The  complainant suffered a cervical dorsal sprain, the symptoms of which persisted at  the time of the trial four years later.The  complainant and Mr. Boudreau gave contradictory versions of the events.  The complainant stated that, at the time of the collision, she was driving in the  left lane because of the slow traffic in the right lane when Mr. Boudreau’s  vehicle forcefully struck hers from behind. As for Mr. Boudreau, he  admitted that he had been driving over the speed limit but said that he had slowed  down prior to the collision because traffic on the highway had become heavier.  According to him, the accident occurred because the complainant suddenly moved  into the left lane without signalling and he was unable to avoid it.In finding  that Mr. Boudreau had been driving erratically prior to the collision, the  judge relied on three witness accounts and a video obtained from a department  of transport camera that showed Mr. Boudreau driving before his vehicle climbed  a hill and went out of camera range. However, because the collision itself  could not be seen on the video, the judge had only the accounts given by the  complainant and Mr. Boudreau available to her to determine what had  happened at the moment of impact. She found that Mr. Boudreau’s version of  events, according to which the complainant had quickly pulled into the left  lane, was inconsistent with the report assessing the damage caused to the  complainant’s vehicle, as the report indicated damage not just to the left rear  corner of the vehicle but to the entire rear structure. The judge reasoned that  if the complainant had suddenly moved into the left lane, the damage would have  been on the left side of her vehicle, not the rear. The judge therefore  accepted the complainant’s version of events and convicted Mr. Boudreau.Mr. Boudreau  appealed his conviction to the Quebec Court of Appeal. He argued that the trial  judge had made errors in assessing the evidence and that those errors had led  to an unreasonable decision. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the  appeal.One Court of Appeal judge dissented. She would have allowed the appeal, set aside the  conviction and ordered a new trial. In her view, the trial judge had made two  errors that had led to an  unreasonable decision. First, the trial judge had wrongly rejected Mr. Boudreau’s  testimony on the basis of an illogical inference, namely that if the complainant had suddenly changed lanes, the impact  would have occurred on the left side of the car, not the left rear corner. In  the dissenting judge’s opinion, Mr. Boudreau’s version of events was  perfectly consistent with the location of the damage, that is, the rear of the  vehicle, particularly the left rear corner. Second, she was of the view that  the trial judge’s finding that the complainant had been driving in the left lane well  before the impact was contradicted by the testimony of the complainant herself,  who stated that she had moved into the left lane because of congestion in the  right lane.Mr. Boudreau  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.<strong>The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. </strong>As a  result, the conviction is upheld.<strong></strong>Justice  Côté read the judgment of the Court.

2024 SCC 8,"<strong>The Supreme Court  clarifies the approach to judicial review where a right of appeal is limited by  statute to questions of law. </strong>This appeal concerned the  proper approach to judicial review where there is a limited statutory right of  appeal. It also addressed whether it was reasonable for Ontario’s Licence  Appeal Tribunal (the Tribunal) to deny, in this case, an insured person’s  request for benefits as time-barred.  Ummugulsum Yatar was  injured in a car accident in Ontario in 2010. Her insurer, TD Insurance Meloche  Monnex, initially paid her the accident benefits to which she was entitled  under Ontario’s insurance legislation scheme. However, in January 2011, the  insurer stopped making those payments because she failed to provide a completed  disability certificate. Her income replacement benefits were reinstated briefly  in February, but were again denied in September of that year. Ms. Yatar contested the  denial of her benefits before the Tribunal, which is an administrative body  mandated by the provincial government to resolve, among other things, disputes  about an insured person’s entitlement to motor vehicle accident benefits under  the province’s insurance legislation scheme. The Tribunal dismissed her  application because it was filed too late. Her subsequent request that the Tribunal  reconsider its decision was also dismissed (the reconsideration decision).Ms. Yatar decided to appeal  the Tribunal’s reconsideration decision to the Divisional Court, a branch of  the Ontario Superior Court. Appeals are usually brought by a dissatisfied party  before a higher court to review the decision of a lower court. However,  legislation can sometimes provide a right to appeal decisions made by an  administrative body like the Licence Appeal Tribunal. This is referred to as a  “statutory right of appeal”, as it derives from a statute (a law). According to  the legislation that governed the Licence Appeal Tribunal, Ms. Yatar had a  right to appeal the Tribunal’s reconsideration decision, but it was limited to alleged  errors by the Tribunal on questions of law. Whereas questions of fact are about  what actually took place between the parties, questions of law are about what  the correct legal test is to apply in a given case.  At the same time, Ms. Yatar  brought an application for judicial review before the Divisional Court.  Judicial review is different from an appeal. It is a process by which courts  review decisions by administrative bodies to make sure they uphold procedural  fairness and are reasonable, meaning they make sense in light of the law and  the facts of the case. Ms. Yatar’s application for judicial review contained  questions of fact or mixed fact and law. These questions pertain to the  application of the law to the facts of a case.The Divisional Court  dismissed Ms. Yatar’s appeal, holding that she failed to show that the Tribunal  made an error of law in its reconsideration decision. It also dismissed her  application for judicial review, stating there were no “exceptional”  circumstances that would justify judicial review in this case. Ms. Yatar appealed the  Divisional Court’s decision to dismiss her application for judicial review to  the Ontario Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal. In its  view, judicial review would only be available in “rare” cases, given the  existing legislative scheme to resolve these disputes, including the right to  ask for reconsideration of the Tribunal’s preliminary decision and the  statutory right of appeal on questions of law. It concluded that the  legislature had intended to limit recourse to courts on other questions arising  from the administrative decision. Ms. Yatar appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has  allowed the appeal. <strong>Judicial review was available to Ms. Yatar for issues not dealt with  under the statutory right of appeal. </strong>Writing for a unanimous  Court, Justice Rowe held that a right of appeal does not preclude an individual  from seeking judicial review for questions not dealt with in the appeal. As he  explained, where there is a statutory right of appeal limited to questions of  law, judicial review is available for questions of fact or mixed fact and  law.  Justice Rowe determined  that it was an error for the courts below to hold that, where there is a  limited right of appeal, judicial review should only be exercised in  exceptional or rare cases. The limited right of appeal from the Tribunal’s  decisions to pure questions of law does not reflect an intention by the  legislature to restrict recourse to courts on other questions arising from the  Tribunal’s administrative decisions. It only denotes an intention to subject  the Tribunal’s decisions on questions of law to correctness review, and  proceeding with judicial review on questions of fact or mixed fact and law is  fully respectful of the legislature’s institutional design choices.Finally, Justice Rowe held  that the Tribunal’s reconsideration decision was unreasonable. Among other  reasons, it failed to have regard to the effect of the reinstatement of the  income replacement benefits between February and September 2011 on the validity  of the initial denial. As such, Justice Rowe allowed the appeal and referred  the matter back to the Tribunal for reconsideration. "
2024 SCC 7,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  credibility and reliability findings by judges in separate criminal trials and restores  the convictions of two men guilty of sexual assault.  </strong>These appeals dealt with the question of how credibility  and reliability assessments by judges in criminal trials should be reviewed on  appeal. They also addressed the role of common sense when assessing the  evidence of witnesses. Christopher James Kruk and Edwin Tsang were convicted  of sexual assault in British Columbia in separate and unrelated cases. In both  cases, the British Columbia Court of Appeal overturned their convictions  because of alleged errors in the way the trial judges assessed the credibility  and reliability of the complainants and the accused. The Court of Appeal found  that the trial judges had made assumptions about human behaviour that were not supported  by the evidence, which led the trial judges to believe the complainants and reject  Mr. Kruk’s and Mr. Tsang’s testimonies for lack of credibility. According to the Court of Appeal, the trial judges’  assumptions were contrary to a new “rule against ungrounded common-sense  assumptions”, which would prevent judges from making speculations based on  generalizations and common sense that are not grounded in the evidence before  them. The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judges had made errors  of law by making assumptions about human behaviour not grounded in the evidence  and that these errors had had an impact on finding Mr.  Kruk and Mr. Tsang guilty, which justified setting aside their convictions and  ordering new trials. The Crown appealed the decisions to the Supreme Court  of Canada. It argued that in both cases, the Court of Appeal should have  deferred to the trial judges’ conclusions on credibility. It also argued that their  conclusions could only be overturned if they had made “palpable and overriding  errors” in their assumptions. A “palpable” error is one that is obvious, and in  this context could include where the assumption in question is obviously  untrue, or where it is untrue or inapplicable in light of the other accepted  evidence or findings of fact in the case. If such an error has been identified,  the appeal court must also conclude that the trial judge’s reliance on the  assumption was “overriding”, meaning it affected the result or went to the core  of the outcome of the case. In the Crown’s opinion, the Court of Appeal  incorrectly relied on the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions, as  opposed to looking for palpable and overriding errors in the assumptions made  by the trial judges to justify overturning their credibility findings.  In response, Mr. Kruk and Mr. Tsang said the trial  judges were wrong to rely on ungrounded common-sense assumptions to find them  less credible. In their view, the Court of Appeal correctly used the rule  against ungrounded common-sense assumptions overturn the trial judges’  credibility findings and set aside their convictions.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeals.  <strong>The rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions should not be  recognized as a new basis for appellate courts to review credibility and  reliability findings by trial judges.</strong>Writing for a majority, Justice Martin said that adopting  a rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions would represent a radical  departure from how appellate courts have typically approached credibility and  reliability assessments, especially in the context of sexual assault. She said  the faulty use of common-sense assumptions in criminal trials should continue  to be controlled by existing standards of review and rules of evidence. In some  cases, a trial judge’s use of common sense will be vulnerable to appellate  review because it discloses recognized errors of law. Otherwise, like with  other factual findings, she said credibility and reliability assessments – and  any reliance on the common-sense assumptions inherent within them – will be  reviewable only for palpable and overriding error.In the instance cases, Justice  Martin assessed the trial judges’ credibility and reliability findings using  the standard of palpable and overriding error and concluded that no such errors  were made. For these reasons, she allowed the appeals and restored Mr. Kruk’s  and Mr. Tsang’s convictions. "
2024 SCC 6,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that a request by police for an IP  address is a search within the meaning of section 8 of the Charter.</strong>This appeal dealt with the question of whether an  internet protocol (IP) address attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy,  such that a request by the police to obtain it constitutes a search under  section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>.  An IP address is a unique identification  number and is necessary to access the Internet. It identifies  Internet-connected activity and enables the transfer of information from one  source to another. Companies that provide access to the Internet, referred to  as Internet service providers, keep track of the user information that attaches  to each IP address. In 2017, the Calgary Police Services began an  investigation into fraudulent online purchases from a liquor store and learned  that the store’s online sales were managed by Moneris, a third-party payment  processing company. The police contacted Moneris to obtain the IP addresses  used for the transactions, and Moneris identified two. The police then obtained  an order from the court compelling the addresses’ Internet service provider to  disclose the name and residential address of the customer for each IP address.  One was registered to Mr. Bykovets, and the other to his father. The police used  this information to obtain and execute search warrants at their residences. Mr.  Bykovets was arrested and charged with offences relating to, among others, the  possession and the use of third parties’ credit cards and personal  identification documents. Before his trial began, Mr. Bykovets challenged the  police’s request to obtain the IP addresses from Moneris, alleging it violated  his right against unreasonable search and seizure under section 8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  The object of section 8 is to protect privacy, including informational privacy.  To establish a violation of his section 8 right, Mr. Bykovets first needed to  show that there had been a “search”. A search occurs where the state invades a  reasonable expectation of privacy. Mr. Bykovets argued he had such an  expectation with respect to his IP address. The trial judge found that the police’s request to  Moneris did not amount to a search because there was no reasonable expectation  of privacy in an Internet user’s IP address. She reasoned that on their own, IP  addresses do not provide a link to, or any other information about, an Internet  user. As such, Mr. Bykovets did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in  his IP address and there was no violation of his section 8 right. He was ultimately  convicted of 14 offences.    A majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal agreed with  the trial judge and dismissed Mr. Bykovet’s appeal. In dissent, one judge would  have allowed his appeal, on the basis that a reasonable expectation of privacy did  attach to the IP addresses. Mr. Bykovets appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court of Canada has allowed the appeal. <strong><em>An IP address attracts a reasonable expectation of  privacy</em>.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis explained  that if section 8 of the <em>Charter </em>was  to meaningfully protect the online privacy of Canadians in today’s overwhelmingly  digital world, it must protect their IP addresses. An IP address is the crucial  link between an Internet user and their online activity. She said “it is the  key to unlocking a user’s Internet activity and, ultimately, their identity,  such that it attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy”. Accordingly, a  request by the state – in this case, the police – for an IP address is a search  under section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. On this basis, Justice Karakatsanis allowed Mr.  Bykovet’s appeal, set aside his convictions and ordered a new trial. "
2024 SCC 5,"<strong>The Supreme  Court upholds the constitutionality of a federal statute affirming Indigenous  peoples’ right of self‑government with respect to child and family services</strong><strong>.</strong>In 2019, Parliament passed the <em>Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and  Métis children, youth and families</em> (Act), which establishes national  standards and provides Indigenous  peoples with effective control over their children’s welfare.First of all, the Act  sets out national standards and principles that establish a normative framework, which applies across the country, for  the provision of culturally appropriate child and family services. For example,  the principle of the best interests of the  child must be a paramount consideration in decisions or actions in relation to  an Indigenous child. The Act also sets out the principle of ensuring cultural  continuity, which is considered essential to the well‑being of children, families  and Indigenous groups, communities or peoples.In addition, the Act affirms the inherent right  of self‑government of Indigenous peoples that is recognized and affirmed by  section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act,  1982</em>. The Act states that this right includes jurisdiction to make laws in  relation to child and family services. For this purpose, the Act establishes a  framework within which Indigenous groups, communities or peoples can exercise  this jurisdiction.Furthermore, the Act specifies how its provisions and Indigenous  peoples’ jurisdiction to make laws in this area will interact with other laws. Section 21  gives the laws made by Indigenous groups, communities or peoples the same force  as federal laws. Lastly, section 22(3) states for greater certainty that Indigenous laws prevail over  provincial laws to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency.After the Act was passed, the Attorney General  of Quebec asked the Quebec Court of Appeal to determine whether the Act was “<em>ultra vires</em>” Parliament’s jurisdiction  under the Constitution of Canada. In other words, the Attorney General asked  whether, in light of the division of federal and provincial powers under  sections 91 and 92 of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1867</em>, Parliament had exceeded the limits of its jurisdiction by  passing the Act. In the opinion it provided in answer to that question, the  Court of Appeal concluded that the Act was constitutionally valid  except for sections 21 and 22(3), the provisions giving the laws of  Indigenous peoples priority over provincial laws.The Attorney General of Quebec and the Attorney  General of Canada both appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from that  opinion. The former argued, among other things, that the entire Act impermissibly  intruded on certain areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. The latter  countered that the Act was a valid exercise of Parliament’s legislative jurisdiction  over “Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians” under section 91(24) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>.The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal of  the Attorney General of Quebec and allowed the appeal of the Attorney General  of Canada.<strong>The  Act is not <em>ultra vires</em> Parliament’s  jurisdiction under the Constitution of Canada.</strong>In a unanimous judgment, the Supreme Court  ruled that the Act as a whole is constitutionally valid. The  essential matter addressed by the Act involves protecting the well‑being of Indigenous  children, youth and families by promoting the delivery of culturally  appropriate child and family services and, in so doing, advancing the process  of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. The Act falls squarely within  Parliament’s legislative jurisdiction under section 91(24) of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1867</em>. The  Court characterized section 21 of the Act as simply an incorporation by  reference provision. Through section 21, Parliament has validly  incorporated by reference the laws, as amended from time to time, of Indigenous  groups, communities or peoples in relation to child and family services. As for  section 22(3), the Court affirmed that it is simply a legislative  restatement of the doctrine of federal paramountcy, under which the provisions of  a federal law prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions of a  provincial law.As the Court noted, “[u]nder  this framework created by the Act, Indigenous governing bodies and the  Government of Canada will work together to remedy the harms of the past and  create a solid foundation for a renewed nation‑to‑nation relationship in the  area of child and family services”. "
2024 SCC 4,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules  that mandate letters delivered by the Premier of Ontario to his cabinet  ministers are exempt from disclosure. </strong> This appeal concerned the issue of whether the public  should have access to mandate letters sent from the Premier of Ontario to his  cabinet ministers shortly after his party formed government in 2018. A journalist from the Canadian Broadcasting  Corporation (CBC) requested access to 23 mandate letters delivered by the  Ontario Premier to each of his cabinet ministers after the 2018 provincial  election. The mandate letters set out the Premier’s views on policy priorities  for the government’s term in office. The Cabinet Office declined the  journalist’s request, claiming the mandate letters were exempt from disclosure under  section 12(1) of Ontario’s <em>Freedom of  Information and Protection of Privacy Act </em>(the Act). In general, freedom of  information legislation such as this Act strikes a balance between public  disclosure and the confidentiality required by the executive to govern  effectively. Section 12(1) of the Act protects the confidentiality of records  that would reveal the substance of Cabinet’s deliberations.The CBC appealed the Cabinet Office’s decision to  Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner. The Commissioner determined  that the mandate letters were not exempt under section 12(1) and ordered their  disclosure. He found that the purpose of the Cabinet records exemption was to  promote the free and frank discussion among Cabinet members of issues coming  before them for decision, without concern for the chilling effect that might  result from disclosure of their statements or the material on which they are  deliberating. However, in his view, section 12(1) was designed to protect  deliberations occurring within Cabinet’s policy-making process, not the  outcomes of that process – the policy decisions themselves – or mere subjects  or topics of deliberation. Under his interpretation of section 12(1), the  Commissioner said the mandate letters were not exempt from disclosure because  nothing suggested they were intended to serve, or served, as the basis for  discussion by Cabinet as a whole. Moreover, rather than revealing the views,  opinions, thoughts, ideas and concerns of ministers, the Commissioner characterized  the mandate letters as the endpoint of the Premier’s formulation of the  policies and goals to be achieved by each Ministry. The Attorney General of Ontario asked the Ontario  Divisional Court to review the Commissioner’s decision. The Divisional Court  determined that the decision was reasonable. On appeal, a majority of the  Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with the Divisional Court. One judge on the  Court of Appeal dissented, finding the Commissioner’s decision unreasonable in  large part because it eroded the sphere of Cabinet privilege that section 12(1)  was designed to preserve. The Attorney General of Ontario appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.<strong>The  Commissioner’s interpretation of the Cabinet records exemption was too narrow. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis ruled the  mandate letters were protected from disclosure under section 12(1) of the Act.  She determined that the opening words of the provision mandate a substantive  analysis of the requested record to determine whether disclosure of the record  would shed light on Cabinet deliberations. A consideration of the text of the  Act, purpose, and context lead to the conclusion that the mandate letters are  protected from disclosure under section 12(1)’s opening words. The mandate  letters reflect the view of the Premier on the importance of certain policy  priorities and mark the initiation (rather than the end) of a fluid process of  policy formulation within Cabinet, and they are revealing of the substance of  Cabinet deliberations.  Justice Karakatsanis concluded: “In approaching  assertions of Cabinet confidentiality, administrative decision makers and  reviewing courts must be attentive to the vital importance of public access to  government-held information but also to Cabinet secrecy’s core purpose of  enabling effective government, and its underlying rationale of efficiency,  candour, and solidarity”. "
2024 SCC 3,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a new trial must be held for 31 persons who were granted a stay of  proceedings by the Superior Court of Quebec. </strong>Following an investigation that began in 2014, a large‑scale  police operation was launched in 2016 in three regions in Quebec. Some 30 persons  were arrested and charged with various indictable offences related to  production of and trafficking in narcotics. At the time they were arrested, the accused persons were all informed  of their constitutional right, guaranteed by section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Many of them indicated that they  wanted to exercise their right as soon as they were informed of it, some did  not ask to exercise their right until they were at the police station, and the  others said that they did not wish to retain and instruct counsel or that they  had already done so. In the end, out of those who indicated a desire to exercise  this right immediately, only one was given an opportunity to do so while in the  police vehicle.The accused persons were divided  into four different groups for separate trials. Those in the first group, who  were to be tried first, filed a motion for a stay of proceedings on the basis  that there had been multiple infringements of their constitutional rights  during the police investigation and operation. In the context of a criminal  case, a stay of proceedings is a remedy that may be granted to an accused person  who establishes that the state’s conduct undermines the integrity of the  justice system, regardless of whether the person has suffered any personal prejudice  or whether the fairness of the person’s trial has been impaired. The accused  persons in this case alleged that an accumulation of infringements of their  constitutional rights, particularly their right to retain and instruct counsel  without delay, amounted to an abuse of process for all of them, even though  several of them were not the victims of any of these infringements. The accused  persons in the other three groups filed motions similar to the one filed by the  first group. The trial judge entered a stay of  proceedings for the accused persons in the first group. He found that the police  practice of postponing the exercise by the accused persons of their right to  counsel until they were taken to the police station infringed the right under section 10(b)  of the <em>Charter</em> of everyone in the  group. Relying on the cumulative effect of these infringements, which he  considered to be the most serious ones, and other infringements that occurred during  the police action, the judge found that there had been an abuse of process by  the police. A stay of proceedings was also entered for the accused persons in  the other three groups on the basis of these findings.The Quebec Court of Appeal  allowed the Crown’s appeals and ordered that a new trial be held, including a  new hearing on the motion for a stay of proceedings. In the Court of Appeal’s view,  some accused persons did not have standing to obtain a stay of proceedings,  because a remedy can be granted only to persons whose own constitutional rights  have been infringed. It was also of the opinion that the trial judge had erred  in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the accused persons without first  assessing whether the rights of each of them had been infringed. The accused  persons appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. <strong>The trial judge erred in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the accused  persons.</strong>Writing for the majority of the  Court, Justice O’Bonsawin ruled that all of the accused persons had  standing to apply for a remedy even though some of them were not the victims of  any of the infringements constituting the alleged abusive conduct.However, the trial judge had to  determine whether each accused person’s right under section 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em> had been infringed, and he did  not do so. Finally, the trial judge erred in entering a stay of proceedings for  all of the accused persons without first considering less drastic remedies that  could have fully redressed the prejudice to the integrity of the justice system  that he thought he had identified. For these reasons, Justice O’Bonsawin concluded  that this error justified holding a new trial for the first group, as well as  new hearings on the accused persons’ motion for a stay of proceedings."
2024 SCC 2,"<strong>The Supreme  Court upholds the verdict by which a former Sûreté du Québec police officer was  convicted of defrauding his employer.<em> </em></strong><strong> </strong>Nicolas Landry  became a police officer with the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) in 2001. In 2009, his  family doctor recommended that he stop working temporarily because of health  problems. His inability to work was confirmed and extended for several years. That  said, while he was off work, Mr. Landry performed a number of activities as  a manager in his former spouse’s travel agencies and travelled frequently.  In  2014, Mr. Landry met with a physician-arbitrator to have his inability to  perform his work as a police officer assessed. During that meeting, Mr. Landry  minimized his role in the travel agencies and negatively presented the state of  his psychological health in general. The SQ had information about Mr. Landry’s  activities at the travel agencies before that meeting, but it did not share it  with the physician‑arbitrator. The physician‑arbitrator found that Mr. Landry  was permanently unable to perform his duties as a police officer. The SQ did  not contest these findings. Because of his permanent disability, Mr. Landry  was entitled from then on to his full salary, including all of his  employment-related benefits, until his retirement in 2026.  Further  to the physician‑arbitrator’s report, the SQ’s professional standards division began  investigating Mr. Landry. The investigation eventually led to a formal charge  of fraud over $5,000 being laid against him.  A Court  of Québec judge convicted Mr. Landry of defrauding the SQ and sentenced  him to six months’ imprisonment. In the judge’s opinion, the Crown had proved all  the constituent elements of the offence of fraud: the commission of a dishonest  act, prejudice or risk of prejudice to the victim’s financial interests, and  subjective knowledge that the dishonest act could result in prejudice to others.  According to the judge, the material non-disclosure by Mr. Landry of the  true nature of his role within the travel agencies constituted a dishonest act.  Furthermore, Mr. Landry knew that his dishonest acts could result in financial  prejudice to the SQ, or put it at risk of prejudice, if it had to pay him his  full salary until his retirement because of his untruthful allegations.  A  majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge and  dismissed the appeal. One judge would have allowed the appeal. In her opinion,  despite the dishonest acts that Mr. Landry was accused of, he did not  cause actual prejudice or a risk of prejudice to the SQ’s interests. Because  the SQ did not contest the physician‑arbitrator’s findings and because  Mr. Landry clearly had a disability, the Sûreté du Québec was obligated to  pay him his full salary. Furthermore, given that the SQ had information about  Mr. Landry’s activities and concealed it from the physician‑arbitrator, it  could not claim that it was deceived and put at risk of prejudice. For these  reasons, the dissenting judge would have replaced the verdict of fraud with a  verdict of attempted fraud, which carries a lower sentence.   Mr. Landry  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  <strong>The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. </strong>
     As a  result, the verdict of fraud is upheld.  Justice  Karakatsanis read the majority judgment of the Court.  A print version of the  judgment that was read out will be available <a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/en/nav.do"">here</a> once finalized. "
2024 SCC 1,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  the acquittal of a Canadian military member accused of sexual assault.</strong> <em></em>
     Private D.T. Vu, a member of the Canadian military,  was charged with sexual assault for allegedly performing a sexual act on a  complainant, who was also a member of the military, without her consent after  they both attended a party and played drinking games. The complainant became  heavily intoxicated and was brought back to her room by colleagues. The accused  was then left alone with the complainant. He used his phone, angled away from  the complainant, to record her apparently consenting to the sexual act for approximately  five minutes until colleagues came back and removed him from her room. The  accused later provided a voluntary statement to the military police, in which he  stated the complainant appeared to be unconscious or asleep towards the end of  the act.  The accused was tried by a military judge in the standing  court martial. In order to find the accused guilty of sexual assault, the Crown  had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he performed the sexual act without  the complainant’s subjective consent. In cases of sexual assault, subjective  consent means the complainant had the “operating mind” to agree to the sexual  activity. To give such consent, the complainant must be capable of  understanding the physical act, that the act was sexual in nature, the specific  identity of the complainant’s partner, and that the complainant had a choice to  refuse to participate in the sexual activity. Subjective consent is different  from “apparent agreement”, or objective evidence of a complainant agreeing to a  sexual act.  The military judge found that the accused was not guilty  of sexual assault. In his view, the Crown had failed to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that the complainant was too intoxicated to consent to the  sexual act. In other words, based on the direct video evidence, the judge  thought it was possible for the complainant to have consented to the sexual act,  in which case the act would not have constituted sexual assault. For this  reason, the accused was acquitted.  The Crown appealed the acquittal to the Court Martial Appeal  Court of Canada. It argued that the military judge did not consider the  entirety of the evidence – including circumstantial evidence such as witness  testimonies and the accused’s statement to the military police – and its  cumulative effect in concluding the Crown failed to prove lack of consent.  A majority of judges dismissed the appeal and upheld  the accused’s acquittal, concluding that the military judge had properly  considered all the evidence. In dissent, one judge would have allowed the  appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial. In her view, the  military judge focused too narrowly on the video evidence, without considering  whether the circumstantial evidence corroborated it. He failed to evaluate the  evidence as a whole to determine whether the complainant was able to consent at  the time of the sexual activity. The dissenting judge concluded that based on  the cumulative assessment of the totality of the evidence before the military  judge, the only reasonable conclusion available was that the complainant had  been unable to provide subjective consent because she was severely intoxicated.  The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. <strong>The Supreme Court dismissed the  appeal. </strong>
     As such, the accused’s  acquittal was upheld.      Chief Justice Wagner read  the judgment of a majority of the Court.
