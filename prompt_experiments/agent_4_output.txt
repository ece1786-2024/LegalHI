Writing for the majority, Justice O'Bonsawin concludes that the trial judge erred in law by mischaracterizing evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant as past discreditable conduct. This error tainted his analysis of both the actus reus and mens rea, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. The majority holds that this error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals, as it undermined the trial judge's credibility assessment of the complainant and failed to appreciate the interconnectedness between her evidence and that of other witnesses. The majority allows the appeal, sets aside the acquittals, and orders a new trial.

In contrast, Justices Côté and Rowe dissenting argue that while there was an error in law regarding past discreditable conduct evidence, it did not have a material bearing on acquittal. They emphasize that credibility findings are owed deference on appeal and note that even if properly assessed, there is no basis for disturbing these findings or inferring intent to exploit from circumstances without additional evidence linking violent behavior to provision sexual services
