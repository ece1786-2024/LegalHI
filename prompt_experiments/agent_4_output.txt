The trial process involved the accused being charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. The complainant testified that she was in a violent relationship with the accused, who suggested she have sex on a webcam for money and eventually persuaded her to offer sexual services for money. The complainant's friends and family testified to the violent relationship but not the sexual services. The trial judge found the complainant's evidence not credible except as corroborated by other witnesses and acquitted the accused.

The trial judge's decision was based on a wrong legal principle, as they characterized the evidence of the accused's violence as past discreditable conduct, which is generally inadmissible. However, the evidence of violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in persons offence and the definition of exploitation. The trial judge's error of law hindered their assessment of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary foundation relevant to the essential elements of the offence.

The appellate process involved the Crown appealing the acquittals, alleging that the trial judge committed three errors of law. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the acquittals, holding that the trial judge assessed some of the evidence based on a wrong legal principle but that the error had no material bearing on the acquittals. The dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence and that treating the accused's violence as past discreditable conduct misapprehended its nature and relevance to the actus reus and mens rea of both offences.

The final decision of the Supreme Court of Canada was to allow the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and order a new trial. The court held that the trial judge assessed the evidence based on a wrong legal principle, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. The court also found that the error of law might have had a material bearing on the acquittals, as the trial judge's assessment of the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was tainted by their mischaracterization of the evidence as past discreditable conduct.
