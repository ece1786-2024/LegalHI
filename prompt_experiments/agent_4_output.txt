The trial process in this case involves the presentation of evidence by the Crown and the defense, with the trial judge assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the relevance of the evidence to the charges. The trial judge's decision is based on their interpretation of the law and the evidence presented, and their reasoning is set out in their written judgment. In this case, the trial judge acquitted the accused, finding that the Crown had not proven the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown appealed the acquittal, arguing that the trial judge had erred in their assessment of the evidence and the law. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal, but the dissenting judge would have ordered a new trial. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal, and ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge had erred in their assessment of the evidence and the law.
