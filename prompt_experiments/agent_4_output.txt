Writing for the majority, O'Bonsawin J. held that the trial judge erred in law by characterizing evidence of the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant as past discreditable conduct. This error tainted the trial judge's analysis of the evidence, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. The majority found that the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence could have been relevant to the essential elements of the offence and could have formed the basis of a finding that the accused controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant during the specified time period. The majority also held that the trial judge's error of law might have had a material bearing on the acquittals, as it undermined the foundation of the acquittals and created a possibility of a different verdict. Therefore, the majority allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial.
