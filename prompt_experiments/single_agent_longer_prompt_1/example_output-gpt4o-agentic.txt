The Supreme Court of Canada orders a new trial for T.J.F., who was previously acquitted on charges of trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from said trafficking.

T.J.F. and the complainant were in a common-law relationship from 2004 to 2012, riddled with violence and financial struggles. The complainant alleges that T.J.F. forced her to provide sexual services for money through physical violence and intimidation, while controlling all related finances. Witnesses including the complainant's family and friends confirmed the existence of a violent relationship but did not provide direct evidence of the alleged trafficking activities.

At trial, the judge acquitted T.J.F., citing a lack of credible evidence directly linking him to trafficking or financial benefit from it. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal largely affirmed the acquittals, although acknowledging a trial judge's legal error in characterizing violence as past discreditable conduct without material effect on the outcome. The dissenting appellate judge argued this mischaracterization undermined the entire verdict.

The Supreme Court held that the trial judge erred by mischaracterizing relevant evidence of violence as mere discreditable conduct, which underpinned the trafficking charge. This error might have materially influenced the judge's decision to acquit. The verdict was overturned, and a new trial ordered.

From this case, the public should understand that legal proceedings demand correct classification and consideration of evidence to uphold both justice and the rule of law. Mischaracterizing critical evidence can potentially skew judicial outcomes, demonstrating the importance of meticulous legal analysis and respect for judicial protocols.
