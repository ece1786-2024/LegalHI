The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the acquittals and orders a new trial.

The case involved an appeal by the Crown from the acquittal of T.J.F. on charges of trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. The complainant, J.D., alleged that she was forced into prostitution by T.J.F., her common-law partner, through threats and violence.

At trial, the complainant testified about her experiences, but the trial judge found her testimony lacking in credibility. The judge also considered evidence from five other witnesses, including family members and friends of the complainant, who testified about the violent relationship between T.J.F. and J.D.

The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals, finding that while there were errors in law made by the trial judge regarding his assessment of some evidence based on a wrong legal principle (ruling that certain evidence was past discreditable conduct), these errors had no material bearing on his reasonable doubt regarding whether T.J.F.'s actions constituted exploitation or whether he benefited from any alleged exploitation.

However, upon further review by Supreme Court Justice O'Bonsawin for a unanimous majority (with Justices Côté and Rowe dissenting), it was determined that this error did have a material bearing on his reasonable doubt regarding whether T.J.F.'s actions constituted exploitation or whether he benefited from any alleged exploitation.

Justice O'Bonsawin held that regular violence and threats of violence against J.D., as well as their violent relationship more generally could amount to exercising control over their movements during this time period if such conduct effectively controlled those movements during this time period; thus meeting one element required under s 27901 CrC - namely "exercising control direction influence".
