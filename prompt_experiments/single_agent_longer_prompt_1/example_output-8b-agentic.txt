The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the trial judge erred in law by characterizing the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant as past discreditable conduct. The trial judge's characterization was based on a wrong legal principle, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence.

The trial judge's error was not merely an incorrect application of law, but rather a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of past discreditable conduct. The trial judge characterized regular violence and threats as "past discreditable conduct" without considering whether it could be relevant to establishing exploitation under s. 279.04 CrC.

The Crown argues that this error had a material bearing on the acquittal, but this is disputed by our colleague JJ.

Our colleague JJ., writing for herself and Rowe JJ., concurring in part with Côté J.'s reasons:

[1]                    In my analysis, I agree with Côté J.'s conclusion that there is no basis for intervention on this issue due to lack of clear error in assessing credibility.

[2]                    However, I disagree with Côté J.'s conclusion that there is no evidentiary basis for finding intent to exploit based on five witnesses' testimony.

[3]                    In my view, even if we consider five witnesses' testimony as part of actus reus analysis rather than past discreditable conduct.

[4]                    There is no evidentiary basis for inferring intent to exploit from patterned violent behavior by an accused in some cases does not mean we can uproot credibility findings so as to make out inference in this case

[5]                    The appeal should be dismissed
