Here are two paragraphs summarizing the procedural history of the case:

The accused, T.J.F., was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge acquitted the accused, finding that while there was evidence of a violent relationship between the accused and the complainant, there was not enough to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had exploited or facilitated the exploitation of the complainant. The Crown appealed this decision to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge had erred in his assessment of certain evidence as "past discreditable conduct" rather than relevant to establishing exploitation.

The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed this appeal, holding that while there may have been an error in law regarding how certain evidence was characterized by trial judge, this error did not have a material bearing on acquittal because it did not affect his credibility findings regarding key witnesses or alter his conclusion about whether actual exploitation occurred. However one justice dissented from this decision arguing that if properly assessed some evidence could have been used by trial judge as part basis for finding respondent exploited complainant which would then allow him infer intent exploit based upon circumstances control & exploitation established through other testimony at trial
