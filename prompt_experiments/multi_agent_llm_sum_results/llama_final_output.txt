The Supreme Court of Canada has ordered a new trial in a human trafficking case, citing a reversible error made by the trial judge in assessing evidence of the accused's violent behavior. The case revolves around the accused, T.J.F., who was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code.

The background of the case reveals a tumultuous common-law relationship between the complainant and the accused, spanning from 2004 to 2012, marked by violence, evictions, and financial difficulties. The complainant alleged that the accused suggested they have sex on a webcam for money, which she was unwilling to do but agreed to avoid the accused's violence. She claimed that the accused persuaded her to dance for men and offer sexual services for money, and that she participated because of the accused's violence. The complainant also claimed that the accused was involved in posting ads offering sexual services and controlled all proceeds.

The accused was acquitted by the trial judge, who found that while there was evidence of a violent relationship between the accused and the complainant, there was not enough to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had exploited or facilitated the exploitation of the complainant. The Crown appealed this decision to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge had erred in his assessment of certain evidence as "past discreditable conduct" rather than relevant to establishing exploitation.

The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed this appeal, holding that while there may have been an error in law regarding how certain evidence was characterized by the trial judge, this error did not have a material bearing on the acquittal because it did not affect his credibility findings regarding key witnesses or alter his conclusion about whether actual exploitation occurred. However, one justice dissented from this decision, arguing that if properly assessed, some evidence could have been used by the trial judge as part of the basis for finding that the respondent exploited the complainant, which would then allow him to infer intent to exploit based upon circumstances of control and exploitation established through other testimony at trial.

The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately allowed the appeal, setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new trial. The majority of the court, led by Justice O'Bonsawin, held that the trial judge erred in law by characterizing evidence of the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant as "past discreditable conduct." This error led to a misapprehension of the evidence, which might have had a material bearing on the acquittals. The majority concluded that the trial judge's error undermined the foundation of the acquittals, and the possibility of a different verdict having been reached is more than abstract or purely hypothetical.

In contrast, Justices Côté and Rowe dissented, arguing that the trial judge's error did not have a material bearing on the acquittals. They emphasized that the trial judge's credibility findings, which were based on a thorough assessment of the evidence, were the basis for his reasonable doubt and the acquittal. The dissenting judges also expressed concern that the majority's reasoning could lead to the collapse of the distinction between the actus reus and mens rea of the offence, effectively creating a new presumption that was not intended by Parliament.
