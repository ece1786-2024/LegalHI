The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new trial. The majority of the court, led by Justice O'Bonsawin, held that the trial judge erred in law by characterizing evidence of the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant as "past discreditable conduct." This error led to a misapprehension of the evidence, which might have had a material bearing on the acquittals. The majority concluded that the trial judge's error undermined the foundation of the acquittals, and the possibility of a different verdict having been reached is more than abstract or purely hypothetical.

In contrast, Justices Côté and Rowe dissented, arguing that the trial judge's error did not have a material bearing on the acquittals. They emphasized that the trial judge's credibility findings, which were based on a thorough assessment of the evidence, were the basis for his reasonable doubt and the acquittal. The dissenting judges also expressed concern that the majority's reasoning could lead to the collapse of the distinction between the actus reus and mens rea of the offence, effectively creating a new presumption that was not intended by Parliament.
