Writing for the majority, Justice O'Bonsawin concludes that the trial judge erred in law by mischaracterizing evidence of the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant as past discreditable conduct. This error tainted the trial judge's analysis of the evidence, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. The majority holds that the Crown has established that the trial judge's reasonable doubts could have been resolved had the error of law not occurred, and therefore allows the appeal, sets aside the acquittals, and orders a new trial.
