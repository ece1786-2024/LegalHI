Here is a concise summary of the court proceedings in one paragraph:

The trial judge acquitted the accused of trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it, despite evidence of a violent relationship between the accused and the complainant. The Crown appealed, arguing that the trial judge erred in assessing some evidence based on a wrong legal principle by ruling that the accused's violence was past discreditable conduct. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals, but a dissenting judge would have ordered a new trial. On appeal to the Supreme Court, Justice O'Bonsawin found that the trial judge did indeed err in law by mischaracterizing evidence of regular violence and threats as past discreditable conduct, which hindered his assessment of essential elements of the offence. She concluded that this error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals and allowed the appeal, setting aside the verdicts and ordering a new trial. In contrast, Justices Côté and Rowe dissented, arguing that while there was an error in law, it did not have a material bearing on the acquittal due to deference owed to credibility findings made by trial judges.
