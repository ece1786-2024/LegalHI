The complainant, J.D., alleged that her intimate partner, T.J.F. (the accused), trafficked her and received a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. The complainant claimed that the accused suggested they have sex on a webcam for money, and she was unwilling to do this but agreed to avoid the accused's violence. She also claimed that the accused persuaded her to dance for men and to offer sexual services for money, and that she participated because of the accused's violence. The accused was charged with trafficking the complainant and receiving a material benefit from it. At trial, in addition to the complainant, five other witnesses testified, including the complainant's brother, mother, and daughter, and two of her friends. These other witnesses did not provide evidence of sexual services, but did provide evidence of the accused's violence towards the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the accused, finding that the complainant's testimony lacked credibility and that there was a reasonable doubt about the accused's ties to any prostitution enterprise. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals, but the dissenting judge would have ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence and that treating the accused's violence as past discreditable conduct misapprehended its nature and relevance to the actus reus and mens rea of both offences.
