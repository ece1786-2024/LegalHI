**The Supreme Court of Canada Sets Aside Acquittals and Orders a New Trial in R. v. T.J.F.**

This appeal concerns the central legal question of whether the trial judge erred in holding that evidence of a violent relationship between the accused and the complainant did not directly address the elements of the offences of trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from trafficking in persons.

**Background**

The complainant, J.D., alleged that her intimate partner, T.J.F. (the accused), trafficked her and received a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. The complainant claimed that the accused suggested they have sex on a webcam for money, and she was unwilling to do this but agreed to avoid the accused's violence. She also claimed that the accused persuaded her to dance for men and to offer sexual services for money, and that she participated because of the accused's violence. At trial, in addition to the complainant, five other witnesses testified, including the complainant's brother, mother, and daughter, and two of her friends, providing evidence of the accused's violence towards the complainant.

**Court Proceedings**

The trial process involved the accused being charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it. The trial judge acquitted the accused, finding that the complainant's testimony lacked credibility and that there was a reasonable doubt about the accused's ties to any prostitution enterprise. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals, but the dissenting judge would have ordered a new trial. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial, holding that the trial judge assessed the evidence based on a wrong legal principle.

**Legal Principle**

Evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim, and their violent relationship, can be relevant and material to both the actus reus of the trafficking in persons offence and the definition of exploitation, and should not be characterized as past discreditable conduct evidence.

**Conclusion**

Writing for the majority, Justice O'Bonsawin concludes that the trial judge erred in law by mischaracterizing evidence of the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant as past discreditable conduct. This error tainted the trial judge's analysis of the evidence, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. The majority holds that the Crown has established that the trial judge's reasonable doubts could have been resolved had the error of law not occurred, and therefore allows the appeal, sets aside the acquittals, and orders a new trial.
