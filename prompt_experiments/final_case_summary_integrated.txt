The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside acquittals in human trafficking case, emphasizing the relevance of evidence of violence in establishing the actus reus and mens rea of the offence.

This appeal addresses the critical issue of human trafficking and the relevance of evidence of violence in establishing the actus reus and mens rea of the offence, specifically whether the trial judge erred in assessing the evidence and failed to consider all relevant evidence in a case where the accused was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it.

The complainant, J.D., and the accused, T.J.F., were in a common-law relationship from 2004 to 2012, marked by violence, evictions, and financial difficulties. The complainant alleged that the accused suggested they have sex on a webcam for money, and she was unwilling to do this but agreed to avoid the accused's violence. She claimed that the accused persuaded her to dance for men and to offer sexual services for money, and that she participated because of the accused's violence. The accused was charged with trafficking the complainant and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code.

The trial process began with the accused being charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it. The complainant testified that she was in a violent and controlling relationship with the accused, who forced her into providing sexual services for money. The Crown called five other witnesses, including the complainant's family members and friends, who testified about the accused's violent behavior towards the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the accused, finding that the complainant's testimony lacked credibility and that there was not enough evidence to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown appealed the acquittals, arguing that the trial judge erred in assessing the evidence and failed to consider all relevant evidence. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the trial judge's error in characterizing some of the evidence as past discreditable conduct did not have a material bearing on the acquittals. However, the dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence and misapprehended the nature and relevance of the violent acts inflicted on the complainant. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial, holding that the trial judge assessed the evidence based on a wrong legal principle, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence.

The critical legal principle established in this case is that evidence of violence and threats of violence by an accused towards a victim, and more generally, a violent relationship between the two, can be relevant and material to the actus reus of the trafficking in persons offence and the definition of exploitation.

Writing for the majority, O'Bonsawin J. held that the trial judge erred in law by characterizing evidence of the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant as past discreditable conduct. This error tainted the trial judge's analysis of the evidence, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. The majority found that the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence could have been relevant to the essential elements of the offence and could have formed the basis of a finding that the accused controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant during the specified time period. The majority also held that the trial judge's error of law might have had a material bearing on the acquittals, as it undermined the foundation of the acquittals and created a possibility of a different verdict. Therefore, the majority allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial, emphasizing the importance of properly assessing evidence in human trafficking cases and highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the relationship between violence, exploitation, and intent.
