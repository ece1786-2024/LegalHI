Here is a case summary of the document:

**Decision:** The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new trial.

**Most important legal or factual question:** Whether the trial judge erred in holding that evidence of a violent relationship between the accused and the complainant did not directly address the elements of human trafficking offenses, and if so, whether this error may have had a material bearing on the acquittal.

**Facts:**

The accused was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it. The complainant alleged that she provided sexual services for money under threat of violence by her intimate partner, who was also her common-law spouse. The couple's relationship was marked by violence, evictions, and financial difficulties. At trial, five other witnesses testified about their observations of the couple's relationship, including instances of violence. However, they did not provide direct evidence of sexual services.

The trial judge acquitted the accused after finding that while there was much to suggest that he was part of a prostitution business, there was not enough to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt. He found that while he accepted some aspects of the complainant's testimony as credible (e.g., her experiences with domestic violence), he had reasonable doubts about other aspects (e.g., whether she provided sex work).

**Judicial History:**

The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals in part because it held that even though some evidence may have been mischaracterized as past discreditable conduct (i.e., bad character), this error did not taint his analysis regarding essential elements or mens rea.

However dissenting Justice Van den Eynden disagreed with this conclusion arguing instead for an order for new trials due largely because such mischaracterization led him into failing consider all relevant facts when reaching conclusions about credibility findings made at lower court levels which ultimately rested upon those same errors committed during original proceedings before being appealed upwards through higher judicial bodies until finally landing here today where we now see them overturned once again thanks largely thanks our colleague over there across aisle whose opinion differs greatly mine own yet still manages somehow manage keep us both engaged throughout lengthy deliberations despite obvious differences between two perspectives presented before us today
