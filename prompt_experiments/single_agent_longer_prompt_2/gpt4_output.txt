In the case of R. v. T.J.F., the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial, with Côté and Rowe JJ. dissenting. The most significant legal question the court needed to resolve was whether the trial judge erred by incorrectly characterizing evidence of the accused's violence towards the complainant as past discreditable conduct, thereby failing to consider its relevance to essential elements of the offence.

Facts of the Case: The complainant was in a common-law relationship with the accused from 2004 to 2012. During this time, the relationship was marked by violence and financial difficulties. The complainant alleged that she provided sexual services for money due to threats and violence by the accused, who was her intimate partner. Witnesses corroborated the violent nature of the relationship but did not provide evidence of sexual services. The accused was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from this trafficking. The trial judge found the complainant’s evidence lacking in credibility and acquitted the accused, concluding that there wasn't enough evidence to tie the accused to a prostitution enterprise beyond reasonable doubt.

Judicial History: At the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the trial judge acquitted the accused, finding that although the complainant experienced significant violence and intimidation, her testimony lacked credibility and did not convincingly tie the accused to a prostitution enterprise. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown's appeal. The majority concluded that although the trial judge made a legal error by improperly treating evidence of violence as past discreditable conduct, this did not materially affect the acquittals since the judge still held reasonable doubt about the accused’s involvement in exploitation. The dissenting judge argued that this mischaracterization of evidence might have impacted the trial judge's legal analysis of the actus reus and mens rea of the offences, warranting a new trial. The Supreme Court of Canada majority agreed with the dissenting opinion from the Court of Appeal, finding that the trial judge's error might have materially impacted the outcome of the trial, thus necessitating a new trial. However, Côté and Rowe JJ. dissented, arguing that the trial judge’s error did not affect the credibility findings or the material outcome of the trial.
