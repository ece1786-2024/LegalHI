**Background**

The case involves an appeal by the Crown against the acquittal of T.J.F., who was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. The complainant, J.D., alleged that she was forced into prostitution by T.J.F., her common-law partner, through threats of violence and actual violence.

**Procedural History**

The trial judge acquitted T.J.F. on both charges, finding that while there was evidence of a violent relationship between T.J.F. and J.D., there was not enough evidence to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt that T.J.F. had exploited J.D. or benefited from any alleged exploitation of her.

The Crown appealed the acquittals to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge had erred in his assessment of the evidence and had failed to consider all relevant evidence.

A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that while the trial judge had made an error in characterizing some evidence as past discreditable conduct, this error did not have a material bearing on the acquittals.

**Court's Decision and Reasoning**

The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new trial.

In its decision, written by Justice O'Bonsawin for six members of the court (with Justices Côté and Rowe dissenting), held that:

* The trial judge erred in law when he characterized some evidence as past discreditable conduct.
* This error led to a misapprehension of this critical piece which seriously undermined his credibility assessment.
* The possibility is more than abstract or purely hypothetical; it is more than just possible; it is reasonably likely.
* Therefore: set aside verdicts; order new trial

Justice Côté wrote for herself (and Justice Rowe):

* Trial Judge made legal error but no basis for disturbing credibility findings
* Legal Error would not have material bearing on Acquittal
