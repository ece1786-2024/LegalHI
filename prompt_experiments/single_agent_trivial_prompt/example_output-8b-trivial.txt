The Supreme Court of Canada, in a 7-0 decision, dismissed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

The accused was charged with trafficking in persons contrary to s. 279.01(1) of the Criminal Code, which provides that every person who recruits, transports, transfers, receives or holds a person for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation is guilty of an indictable offense.

The trial judge found that the evidence of regular violence and threats by the accused towards the complainant was not relevant to establishing exploitation under s. 279.04(1) CrC.

However, this finding is incorrect as it fails to consider whether regular violence could be used as evidence to establish exploitation under s. 279.04(1) CrC.

To establish exploitation under s. 279.04(1) CrC., there must be conduct that causes or threatens harm if she does not provide sexual services.

In this case, there is no evidence that regular violence can be used as evidence to establish exploitation under s.,

Section 279.(4). The Crown's burden on appeal is high due to "the restricted nature" of its ability "to appeal" and "double jeopardy associated with a new trial".

The majority reasons are based on an error in law regarding past discreditable conduct and its effect on credibility findings by trial judges are owed deference on appeal (para.).

A criminal conviction requires proof beyond reasonable doubt (para.).

In this case,

[161]                     The respondent’s acquittal should have been set aside because his acquittal would not have been different had he erred (para.).

[162]                     In dismissing the respondent’s acquittal,

[163]                     The court held that there was no material bearing on it (paras.).

[164]                     In conclusion,

[165]                     The court held that there was no material bearing on it (paras.).
