Here is a concise summary of the background of the case in one paragraph, including the complainant, the accused, the alleged offences, and references to applicable sections of the Criminal Code:

The complainant (J.D.) and her common-law partner (T.J.F., also known as "the accused") were in a violent and controlling relationship from 2004 to 2012. The complainant alleged that she was forced into prostitution by the accused, who posted ads for her services on Craigslist and controlled all proceeds. The accused was charged with trafficking in persons (s. 279.01(1) of the Criminal Code) and receiving a material benefit from it (s. 279.02(1)). At trial, five other witnesses testified about their observations of violence between the couple, but did not provide direct evidence of prostitution or exploitation. The trial judge acquitted the accused due to concerns about credibility issues with some witnesses' testimony.
