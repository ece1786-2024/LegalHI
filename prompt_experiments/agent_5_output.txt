The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new trial. The majority held that the trial judge erred in law by characterizing evidence of the accused's violence towards the complainant as past discreditable conduct, which hindered his assessment of the evidence and diminished the evidentiary foundation relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in persons offence. The majority found that the error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals, as it undermined the trial judge's credibility assessment of the complainant and the interconnectedness between the complainant's evidence and the evidence of other witnesses.

In dissent, Côté and Rowe JJ. agreed that the trial judge made a legal error in characterizing the evidence as past discreditable conduct, but disagreed that the error had a material bearing on the acquittals. They held that the trial judge's credibility findings were the basis for his reasonable doubt and acquittal, and that there was no proper basis in law to set aside his conclusion. The dissenting judges were concerned that the majority's reasoning came close to establishing a ground of appeal for unreasonable acquittal, which is not available to the Crown, and may encourage courts to collapse the distinction between the actus reus and mens rea of the offence.
