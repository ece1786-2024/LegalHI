Here is the background of the case in one paragraph:

The complainant and the accused were in a common law relationship from 2004 to 2012, marked by violence, evictions, and financial difficulties. The complainant alleged that the accused suggested they have sex on a webcam for money, and she was unwilling to do this but agreed to avoid the accused's violence. She claimed that the accused persuaded her to dance for men and offer sexual services for money, and that she participated because of the accused's violence. The complainant also alleged that the accused was involved in posting ads offering sexual services and controlled all proceeds. The Crown charged the accused with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it under sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code.

Here are two paragraphs summarizing the procedural history of the case:

The accused, T.J.F., was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge acquitted the accused, finding that while there was evidence of a violent relationship between the accused and the complainant, there was not enough to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had exploited or benefited from any alleged exploitation of the complainant. The Crown appealed this decision to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal.

The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals, finding that while the trial judge had assessed some evidence based on a wrong legal principle by ruling that certain evidence was past discreditable conduct, this error did not have a material bearing on the acquittals. However, one judge dissented and would have ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge's mischaracterization of certain evidence as past discreditable conduct had tainted his analysis and may have affected his credibility assessment of key witnesses. The Crown then appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.

The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new trial. The majority held that the trial judge erred in characterizing evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant as "past discreditable conduct," which is generally inadmissible. This error led to a misapprehension of the evidence, hindering his assessment of whether the accused controlled, directed, or influenced the complainant's movements for the purpose of exploiting her. The majority found that this error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals.

In contrast, Justices Côté and Rowe dissented, arguing that while there was an error in law, it did not have a material bearing on the acquittal. They emphasized that credibility findings by trial judges are owed deference on appeal and that there was no basis to disturb these findings in this case.
