The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new trial. The majority held that the trial judge erred in characterizing evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant as "past discreditable conduct," which is generally inadmissible. This error led to a misapprehension of the evidence, hindering his assessment of whether the accused controlled, directed, or influenced the complainant's movements for the purpose of exploiting her. The majority found that this error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals.

In contrast, Justices Côté and Rowe dissented, arguing that while there was an error in law, it did not have a material bearing on the acquittal. They emphasized that credibility findings by trial judges are owed deference on appeal and that there was no basis to disturb these findings in this case.
