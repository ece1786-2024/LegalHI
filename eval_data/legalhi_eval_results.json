The complainant alleged that the accused forced her into prostitution and controlled her movements through violence and threats. The accused was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. The complainant testified that the accused suggested she engage in prostitution, and she eventually agreed due to his violence and threats.\n\nAt trial, the Crown called six witnesses, including the complainant, and tendered six exhibits. The accused elected not to testify. The trial judge acquitted the accused, finding that the complainant's testimony lacked credibility and that the evidence of the other witnesses did not directly address the essential elements of the offences. The Crown appealed the acquittals, arguing that the trial judge erred in assessing the evidence based on a wrong legal principle and failed to consider all the evidence. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the trial judge's error had no material bearing on the acquittals. The dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, holding that the trial judge erred in characterizing the evidence of the accused's violence towards the complainant as past discreditable conduct.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim, and their violent relationship, can be relevant and material to both the actus reus of the trafficking in persons offence and the definition of exploitation, and can form the basis of a finding that the accused controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the victim during the time period specified in the indictment.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice OBonsawin held that the trial judge erred in law by mischaracterizing evidence of the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant as past discreditable conduct. This error tainted the trial judge's assessment of the evidence, particularly with respect to the actus reus and mens rea of the trafficking in persons offence. The majority concluded that the error may have had a material bearing on the acquittal, as it undermined the foundation of the acquittals and created a possibility of a different verdict. Therefore, the majority allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets  aside a man\u2019s acquittals for trafficking in persons and orders a new trial.</strong>This appeal addresses whether  evidence of past violence may be relevant to the offence of trafficking in persons  in a criminal prosecution.From 2004 to 2012, the complainant  and the accused were in a common law relationship that was plagued by violence  and financial difficulties. According to the complainant, the accused persuaded  her to have sex on a webcam for money, dance for men, and offer sexual services  for money, which she did because of the accused\u2019s violence and threats towards  her. She also claimed that the accused was deeply involved in the sexual services, including posting ads offering sexual  services, and received all the money. She  stated that this continued  until she left the accused in 2012. The accused was charged with trafficking in  persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections  279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. At trial, the  complainant and five other witnesses provided evidence of the accused\u2019s  violence towards the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the accused. He  accepted that the complainant was in a violent relationship with the accused, but  he found her testimony lacking in credibility. He also had a reasonable doubt  about the accused\u2019s ties to any prostitution enterprise. He considered the evidence  from the other witnesses as backdrop, but not in relation to the alleged  offences, concluding that it related to \u201cpast discreditable conduct\u201d. Evidence  of past discreditable conduct relates to past misconduct of the accused that  goes beyond what is alleged by the prosecution in relation to an offence and is  not normally admissible. The Crown appealed the  acquittals to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge should have  considered the evidence of the other witnesses about the accused\u2019s violence  towards the complainant. The majority of the Court of Appeal confirmed the  acquittals. It held that the trial judge was wrong to conclude that the accused\u2019s violence was past discreditable conduct but that  the error did not have a significant impact on the  acquittals. The majority also concluded that the trial judge did not fail  to consider all the evidence. The dissenting judge would have ordered a new  trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence, and  that treating the accused\u2019s violence as past discreditable conduct  misapprehended its nature and relevance to the elementsof both offences that the Crown needed to establish. The Crown  appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has  allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial.<strong>Evidence of regular violence, threats of violence, and a  violent relationship may be relevant to the elements of the offence of  trafficking in persons.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin concluded that the trial judge assessed the  evidence based on a wrong legal principle by determining that the evidence of  violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was  evidence of past discreditable conduct. This error of law hindered his  assessment of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary  foundation relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in  persons offence and the definition of exploitation set  out in section 279.04 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. The trial  judge\u2019s error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals. They should  therefore be set aside and a new trial ordered.",

In 2016, TransAlta entered into an Off-Coal Agreement with the Crown in Right of Alberta, agreeing to cease coal-fired emissions by December 31, 2030, in exchange for substantial transition payments from Alberta for 14 years to compensate TransAlta for the loss resulting from the reduced life of its coal-fired facilities. The Minister of Municipal Affairs established the 2017 Alberta Linear Property Assessment Ministers Guidelines, which provide that TransAlta and other parties to off-coal agreements are ineligible to claim additional depreciation to account for the reduced life of their coal-fired facilities.\n\nThe trial judge upheld the validity of the Linear Guidelines, finding that they did not discriminate against TransAlta. The Court of Appeal of Alberta unanimously dismissed TransAlta's appeal, holding that the Linear Guidelines did not discriminate against TransAlta and that the trial judge did not err in finding that they were within the Minister's authority. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, TransAlta argued that the Linear Guidelines are ultra vires the Minister under the Municipal Government Act, violating the common law rule against administrative discrimination and being inconsistent with the purposes of the MGA. The Supreme Court applied the reasonableness standard of review, as established in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that subordinate legislation that discriminates in the administrative law sense is invalid unless the discrimination is authorized by the enabling statute, either expressly or by necessary implication, and that the reasonableness standard of review applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Cote held that the Linear Guidelines are intra vires the Minister of Municipal Affairs under the Municipal Government Act, as they are consistent with the purposes of the MGA and the Minister's broad authority to establish valuation standards for linear property. The court found that the Linear Guidelines discriminate against TransAlta and other parties to off-coal agreements by depriving them of the ability to claim additional depreciation, but this discrimination is statutorily authorized by necessary implication. The court concluded that the Linear Guidelines are consistent with the purposes of the MGA, which include ensuring that assessments are current, correct, fair, and equitable. Ultimately, the court dismissed the appeal, holding that the Linear Guidelines are intra vires the Minister and do not contravene the common law rule against administrative discrimination.",

Auer</a></em>, which was released on the same day, are both about the  standard of review that applies when subordinate legislation is challenged on  judicial review before a court. Subordinate legislation sets out legally  binding rules that are not made by a legislature, such as the Legislative  Assembly of Alberta, but instead by another entity given authority to make them  by that legislature.<strong> </strong>The standard of  review is the approach a court takes to analyzing a decision, like a decision  to make subordinate legislation.TransAlta  Generation Partnership owns coal-fired electric power generation  facilities in Alberta. In 2016, TransAlta entered into an agreement with  Alberta. It agreed to cease  coal-fired emissions on or before December 31, 2030, in exchange for  substantial transition payments from Alberta for 14 years to compensate for losses  resulting from the reduced life of its coal-fired facilities. TransAlta\u2019s  coal-fired facilities are assessed as \u201clinear property\u201d for municipal tax  purposes. Alberta\u2019s <em>Municipal Government Act </em>authorizes the Minister of  Municipal Affairs to establish guidelines for assessing the value of linear  property. In 2017, the Minister  established the <em>2017 Alberta Linear  Property Assessment Minister\u2019s Guidelines </em>under the Act. The  Guidelines, which are subordinate  legislation, deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim a more favourable tax position because  of the reduction in its facilities\u2019 lifespan resulting from the off-coal agreement. TransAlta said the Minister had gone beyond his authority in making the Guidelines  (that they were <em>ultra vires</em>) because they  are discriminatory and inconsistent with the purposes of the Act.The Court of King\u2019s  Bench said the Guidelines were valid and did not discriminate against TransAlta. The Court  of Appeal dismissed TransAlta\u2019s appeal.  The Court of Appeal held that the principles articulated in the Supreme Court  of Canada\u2019s decision in <em>Katz Group  Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care)</em> determined how the  Guidelines should be reviewed. That decision says that in order to find subordinate  legislation to be beyond the authority  granted by a statute because it is inconsistent with the purpose of that  statute, it had to be shown that it was  \u201cirrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated\u201d to the purpose. The Court of Appeal  held that the subsequent decision  in <em><a href=\"../2019/37748-eng.aspx\">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em> did not  change these principles. Following <em>Vavilov</em>,the presumptive standard of review is  reasonableness. A reasonable decision  is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It has to make sense in light of the  law and the facts, but need not be the only right answer. TransAlta appealed again to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed its appeal. <strong>The  guidelines fall reasonably within the scope of the Minister\u2019s authority under Alberta\u2019s <em>Municipal Government Act</em>.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained that the reasonableness standard under <em>Vavilov</em> presumptively applies when  reviewing whether subordinate legislation was authorized by law. Certain  principles from <em>Katz Group </em>continue  to inform reasonableness review, but for a court to  find subordinate legislation to be beyond  the authority granted in statute because  it is inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it no longer  needs to be \u201cirrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated\u201d to that purpose. The  governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law rules, and  the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant  constraints when determining whether subordinate  legislation falls reasonably within the scope of the authority. In the instant case, no exception to the  presumption of reasonableness review applies. Having regard to the governing  statutory scheme, the principles of statutory interpretation, and the common  law rule against administrative discrimination, the Guidelines are within the scope  of the Minister\u2019s authority.",

A concurring judge held that the reasonableness standard applies when reviewing the vires of the Guidelines. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately heard the appeal and dismissed it, upholding the vires of the Guidelines.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada established that the reasonableness standard, as set out in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

However, the Court departed from Katz Group and held that for subordinate legislation to be found ultra vires on the basis that it is inconsistent with the purpose of the enabling statute, it no longer needs to be irrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated to that statutory purpose.\n\nWriting for the majority, the Chief Justice held that the reasonableness standard presumptively applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. This standard requires that the reviewing court determine whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2013 justification, transparency, and intelligibility \u2013 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision. The Chief Justice concluded that the Guidelines fall reasonably within the Governor in Council's scope of authority under s. 26.1 of the Divorce Act, having regard to the relevant constraints.

However, the maximum penalty for these offences was later increased to 14 years. The respondents first appeared in the Court of Quebec in the summer of 2019 and reserved or postponed their right to elect their mode of trial to a later date. After the amendment to section 535 came into force on September 19, 2019, the respondents requested a preliminary inquiry, but the Crown argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry under the new rule.\n\nThe Court of Quebec held that the new section 535 applied to the respondents and that it lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry. The respondents challenged this decision, and the Court of Appeal concluded that the new rule did not apply to the respondents and that they had a vested right to preliminary inquiries. The Court of Appeal remitted the files to the Court of Quebec for preliminary inquiries. The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the respondents had no right to a preliminary inquiry because they were not charged with offences for which they could be personally liable to 14 years or more of imprisonment.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada considered the temporal application of the new section 535 and the interpretation of the 14-year imprisonment threshold. The court held that the new rule applies to accused persons where no request for a preliminary inquiry was made prior to its coming into force. The court also held that the 14-year imprisonment threshold refers to the maximum sentence faced by the accused regarding the actual offence with which they are charged, rather than the maximum sentence that could have been imposed if the offence had been committed at a different time.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that the right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time charges are laid and is considered a substantive right that can interfere with an individual's liberty and security. The amendment to section 535 of the Criminal Code cannot be considered purely procedural and does not apply retroactively to cases where the charging of the accused occurred before its coming into force.\n\nWriting for the majority, the court held that the respondents had a vested right to a preliminary inquiry, as this right crystallizes at the time charges are laid. The majority concluded that the legislative amendment does not eliminate the right to a preliminary inquiry for accused persons charged before it came into force, and that the amendment is procedural in nature but affects a substantive right. The majority also interpreted the scope of section 535 of the Criminal Code, holding that an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry if their alleged offense, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment, and that this right is not affected by the accused's right to the benefit of the lesser punishment.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that new restrictions on the availability of preliminary inquiries do not apply  to certain ongoing criminal proceedings.</strong>This is an appeal about the interpretation of a new rule limiting  who is eligible to have a preliminary inquiry as part of their criminal  proceedings. A preliminary inquiry is a hearing before a court to determine  whether there is enough evidence against an accused person to proceed with a  trial.In unrelated cases, Ag\u00e9nor Archambault and  Gilles Grenier were charged with one or more historical sexual offences against  a child. After the dates of the alleged offences and before charges were laid in  2019, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased from 10 to 14  years\u2019 imprisonment. Since the law in place at the time  of the alleged crime governs the maximum sentence, the maximum that applies to  the cases of Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier is 10 years, not 14 years.In 2020, Mr.\u00a0Archambault and  Mr.\u00a0Grenier each requested a preliminary inquiry. However, under an  amendment to s.\u00a0535 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> that took effect on September 19, 2019, the availability of  preliminary inquiries was now restricted to accused persons charged with  offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment. In both cases,  the Crown argued that, under the amended version of s.\u00a0535, the court  could not hold a preliminary inquiry.The Court of Qu\u00e9bec held that the new  s.\u00a0535 applied to Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier and that it  lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry. Both of them  challenged that interpretation before the Superior Court but were unsuccessful.  They argued that they had the right to a preliminary inquiry because the new  rule in s. 535 did not apply to their proceedings. They also argued that even  under the new rule they were still entitled to a preliminary inquiry. They said  their offences should be considered punishable by 14 years or more for the  purposes of the new rule.The Court of Appeal  allowed their further appeals and sent the cases back to the Court of Qu\u00e9bec  for preliminary inquiries. The  Court of Appeal concluded that the amended version of s.\u00a0535 did not apply  to Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier. They had an entitlement to  preliminary inquiries before s.\u00a0535 was amended. The Court of Appeal  decided that the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry is based on the date of  the alleged offence. Given its conclusion, the Court of Appeal did not address  the question of how the amended version of s.\u00a0535 should be interpreted.The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier were not entitled to a preliminary inquiry. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.<strong>A  preliminary inquiry is available where the person is charged with an offence for  which they actually face a maximum sentence of at least 14 years</strong><strong> and in some other cases on  a transitional basis.</strong>A majority of the Court held that both Mr.  Archambault and Mr. Grenier were entitled to the preliminary inquiries they  requested. The old version of s. 535 continued to apply to them, rather than  the new rule. The fact that they had not requested a preliminary inquiry before  the change in the law was not determinative of their entitlement to preliminary  inquiries.A different majority of the  Court held that neither Mr. Archambault nor Mr. Grenier was eligible for a  preliminary inquiry under the new rule if it applied, as the offences were each  punishable by a maximum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. The new rule in s. 535  requires that the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years\u2019 imprisonment  in respect of the offence with which they are charged for a preliminary inquiry  to be available.",

Wolfe was found guilty of two counts of criminal negligence causing death (s. 220) and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge imposed a driving prohibition order pursuant to s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code, in addition to the sentence of imprisonment. The relevant offences under the Criminal Code are s. 220, s. 221, and s. 320.24(4), which permits discretionary driving prohibition for enumerated offences, including dangerous operation of a conveyance (s. 320.13).\n\nThe court process began with the trial judge convicting Wolfe of the three criminal negligence charges and imposing driving prohibition orders of 10 years on each count of criminal negligence causing death and 7 years on the count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan dismissed Wolfe's appeal, holding that the driving prohibition orders were lawful. However, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal and set aside the order of driving prohibition imposed on Wolfe.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada established that a driving prohibition can only be imposed under s. 320.24(4) of the Canadian Criminal Code if the offender is found guilty of an offense that is explicitly enumerated under that subsection. \n\nWriting for the majority, Martin J. disagreed with the Court of Appeal's interpretation of s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code, concluding that the driving prohibitions imposed on Wolfe were unlawful. The majority held that the Crown's proposed interpretation conflicted with the text of s. 320.24(4), sat in tension with surrounding statutory context and purpose, and failed to fully accord with criminal law principles. The decision clarifies the application of Section 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code and ensures that the law is consistently applied across Canada, upholding the principle of fair notice and the rule against multiple convictions.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets  aside a driving prohibition order because that sentence was not available to  the sentencing judge under the Criminal Code.</strong>This appeal deals with the interpretation  of s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,  which allows a judge to impose a driving prohibition where a person has been  found guilty of one of the specified driving offences.Braydon Wolfe drove on the wrong  side of a divided highway and caused a head-on collision, killing two people  and seriously injuring another. He was found guilty of two counts of criminal  negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily  harm. In his reasons, the trial judge held that, if his analysis of the  criminal negligence counts was wrong, then he would convict the accused of two  counts of dangerous driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving  causing bodily injury. In addition to sentencing the accused to terms of  imprisonment, the trial judge issued a driving prohibition order imposing  concurrent 10-year driving prohibitions for each criminal negligence causing  death count and a concurrent 7-year prohibition for the criminal negligence  causing bodily harm count. Concurrent sentences are sentences for more than one  crime which are to be served at one time. Mr. Wolfe appealed against the length  of the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge. On appeal, the  court raised the question of whether the driving prohibitions could stand in  light of recent amendments to the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr.  Wolfe\u2019s sentence appeal. With respect to the availability of the driving  prohibition order, the court interpreted s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which permits sentencing  judges to impose a driving prohibition where an offender has been \u201cfound  guilty\u201d of one of the offences specified in that provision, as authorizing that  order, even though the offences are not specified offences. It held that the  criminal negligence convictions necessarily included a finding of guilt for the  lesser offence of dangerous driving, which is one of the offences specified in  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  Mr. Wolfe appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that recent  amendments to the <em>Criminal Code </em>did  not allow the sentencing judge to impose driving prohibition orders.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal and set aside the driving prohibition order imposed on Mr. Wolfe.<strong>Driving prohibitions could not be ordered because that sentence was not  available as an option to the sentencing judge.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin held that the driving prohibitions imposed on Mr. Wolfe  were unlawful. Mr. Wolfe was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and  criminal negligence causing bodily harm, which are not specified offences under  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. He  was not \u201cfound guilty\u201d of a specified offence within the meaning of that  provision.

(Golden Oaks) and its sole owner, shareholder, and directing mind, Joseph Gilles Jean Claude Lacasse (Mr. Lacasse). The scheme involved offering investors high-interest rates on promissory notes, and using funds from new investors to pay existing investors. The scheme collapsed in 2013, and Golden Oaks and Mr. Lacasse filed for bankruptcy. The trustee in bankruptcy, Doyle Salewski Inc., commenced actions against the investors to recover the payments made by Golden Oaks, claiming that the interest rates were illegal and the investors were unjustly enriched.\n\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario initially heard the matter, and the trial judge found that Golden Oaks was a Ponzi scheme and attributed Mr. Lacasse's knowledge to the company. However, the judge concluded that the trustee's actions were not statute-barred because legal proceedings were not appropriate before the trustee was appointed. The Court of Appeal for Ontario agreed that the trustee's actions were not statute-barred but exercised discretion not to attribute Lacasse's knowledge to Golden Oaks on public policy grounds. The matter was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the trustee's actions were not statute-barred by the Limitations Act, 2002. The majority of the Court applied the principles of corporate attribution, summarized in Aquino v. Bondfield Construction Co., which apply to one-person corporations. The Court of Appeal properly exercised its discretion not to attribute Lacasse's knowledge to Golden Oaks, as this would have undermined the purposes of the discoverability rules and bankruptcy provisions.\n\nThe key legal principle established in this case is that courts have discretion to refrain from attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind to the corporation when doing so would not promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Jamal holds that the trustee's actions are not statute-barred by the Limitations Act, 2002, as the principles of the corporate attribution doctrine apply to one-person corporations. The Court of Appeal appropriately exercised its discretion to refuse to attribute Mr. Lacasse's knowledge to the company because this would not have promoted the purposes of the laws under which attribution was sought. The doctrine of corporate attribution must be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically to give effect to the policy of the law under which attribution is sought.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that claims against a company operating a Ponzi scheme are not  statute-barred. </strong>Joseph  Lacasse owned and operated Golden Oaks Enterprises Inc, a rent-to-own residential  property company. Lorne Scott, one of the  appellants, was a real estate agent who was paid interest and commissions to  recruit new investors. The company  appeared to be successful, but, in reality, was a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme  is a form of fraud in which existing investors are paid with funds collected  from new investors. In this case, Mr. Lacasse lured investors to lend money to  the company for unlawfully high interest rates, and then paid existing  investors by recruiting new investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed in July 2013.  Doyle Salewski Inc. served as the \u201ctrustee in bankruptcy\u201d. A trustee  administers the property of a bankrupt person under the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act </em>(\u201c<em>BIA</em>\u201d).  Salewski started legal proceedings against the investors to recover the illegal  interest and commissions they were paid by Golden Oaks, arguing that they were  unjustly enriched. The investors argued in response that the actions were  statute-barred under Ontario\u2019s <em>Limitations  Act, 2002</em>, because Mr. Lacasse knew of the illegal payments when they were  made. The <em>Limitations Act, 2002 </em>says  that legal proceedings generally cannot be started more than two years after  the person making the claim knew or ought to have known of the claims. After  that point, they become \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.The  trial judge attributed Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge to the company. However, she found  that the trustee\u2019s actions against the company were not statute-barred for  other reasons. She ordered the investors to return the illegal interest  payments they had received. The investors appealed the trial judge\u2019s decision,  arguing that she had wrongly concluded that the actions were not statute-barred.  The trustee also appealed the trial judge\u2019s decision that Mr. Lacasse\u2019s  knowledge should be attributed to Golden Oaks. The  Court of Appeal did not accept the investors\u2019 arguments, and agreed with the  trustee that the trial judge should not have attributed Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge  to the company. The Court of Appeal concluded that there are public interest reasons  to ensure that those who benefitted from the Ponzi scheme could not avoid being  held responsible in legal proceedings by attributing Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge to  the company. The legal proceedings were therefore not statute-barred because Golden  Oaks did not have the knowledge to bring the actions at the relevant time. The  investors appealed to the Supreme Court, primarily on the grounds that Mr.  Lacasse\u2019s knowledge must be attributed to Golden Oaks, because it is a  one-person corporation and the two are essentially the same. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The knowledge of the sole officer and  shareholder of Golden Oaks should not be attributed to the corporation.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice Jamal concluded that the trustee\u2019s actions are not  statute-barred by the <em>Limitations Act,  2002</em>. The principles of the corporate attribution doctrine, summarized in  the companion appeal <em>Aquino v. Ernest  &amp; Young Inc.</em>, 2024 SCC 31, apply to one-person corporations. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. The Court of Appeal was therefore correct to  conclude that Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge should not be attributed to the company.  This would not have promoted the purposes of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> or the <em>BIA</em>,  which include avoiding the injustice of barring a claim before a person is able  to make it, and ensuring a fair distribution of the bankrupt person\u2019s assets  and protecting the public interest.

(Forma-Con) were two family-owned construction companies experiencing financial difficulties. The companies' president, John Aquino, and other individuals engaged in a false invoicing scheme, fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from the companies. The scheme involved creating false invoices from suppliers for services that were never provided, which were then paid by the companies at the direction of Mr. Aquino or other accomplices. The monitor and trustee in bankruptcy discovered the scheme during their investigations and challenged the transactions as transfers at undervalue under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA.\n\nThe application judge held that the false invoice payments were transfers at undervalue and could be recovered by the monitor and trustee in bankruptcy under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA. The judge also attributed Mr. Aquino's fraudulent intent to Bondfield and Forma-Con using the corporate attribution doctrine. The Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed this decision, rejecting arguments that Mr. Aquino did not intend to defraud or delay creditors because the companies were financially stable when the transactions occurred. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal with costs, upholding both lower courts' decisions.\n\nThe corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically in bankruptcy and insolvency law; attributing actions or intent serves policy goals when it protects creditors' interests.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Jamal held that the application judge did not misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent and that the directing mind's fraudulent intent should be attributed to the corporate debtor under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA. The majority opinion emphasized that a court may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) even if the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfer at undervalue. Furthermore, Jamal J. reasoned that attributing Mr. Aquino's fraudulent intent to Bondfield and Forma-Con would advance the public policy underlying section 96 of the BIA by allowing creditors to recover fraudulently transferred assets.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that the fraudulent intent of the president of two construction  companies can be attributed to the companies in bankruptcy proceedings.</strong>This  appeal addressed when a court can attribute the intent of a senior officer or  employee, known as a \u201cdirecting mind\u201d, to the corporation. John  Aquino was the president of two family-owned construction companies that worked  on large-sale construction projects. When the companies began experiencing  serious financial difficulties, investigations revealed that Mr. Aquino and  several others had been fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from  the companies through a false invoicing scheme. For years, they created fake  invoices from fake suppliers for services that were never provided, and then  directed the construction companies to pay the invoices. In bankruptcy  proceedings against the companies, these payments were challenged under s.  96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>Bankruptcy and  Insolvency Act</em> (\u201c<em>BIA</em>\u201d). This  provision allows for the recovery of money if a transaction is a \u201ctransfer at  undervalue\u201d and the debtor intended to \u201cdefraud, defeat or delay a creditor\u201d. A  transfer at undervalue is a transaction where property or services are provided  to another person for nothing in exchange or for much less than fair market  value. The  application judge concluded that the false invoice payments were transfers at  undervalue. She found that the payments involved several \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d,  which are suspicious circumstances that may help prove fraudulent intent. She  rejected the argument that the construction companies could not have had fraudulent  intent because they were paying their creditors in full and on time at the time  of the payments. She considered the purpose of bankruptcy legislation, which is  to provide a remedy to creditors, and concluded that Mr. Aquino\u2019s intent should  be attributed to the companies. She ordered Mr. Aquino and others to pay the  money they received under the scheme. Mr. Aquino and the others involved in the  scheme appealed the application judge\u2019s ruling. Both before the Court of Appeal  and the Supreme Court, they repeated the arguments made before the application  judge. The Court of Appeal upheld the application judge\u2019s ruling. <strong>The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.</strong>Writing  for the Court, Justice Jamal concluded that the application judge did not  misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent. A court  may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under  s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>BIA </em>even if  the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfer at undervalue. There  is therefore no basis to interfere with the application judge\u2019s conclusion that  Mr. Aquino intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor under the false  invoicing scheme. Furthermore, Mr. Aquino\u2019s fraudulent intent should be  attributed to the debtor companies because he was their directing mind and  acted in the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to him. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. In the context of a claim under s. 96 of the <em>BIA</em>, the \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cno benefit\u201d exceptions  to corporate attribution should not apply because these exceptions would  undermine the purpose of this provision. The test for corporate attribution  under s. 96 is simply whether the person was the directing mind and whether  their actions were performed within the sector or corporate responsibility  assigned to them.",

The Regulations were enacted to provide minimum compensation to passengers on flights to and from Canada in case of delay, cancellation, denial of boarding, and lost or damaged baggage. The airlines alleged that these provisions conflicted with the exclusivity principle codified in Article 29 of the Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, which was implemented into Canadian law by amendments to the Carriage by Air Act. The Montreal Convention is an international treaty that governs damages liability of international air carriers.\n\nThe appellants initially brought a statutory appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, challenging the provisions of the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed most parts of the challenge but allowed one aspect related to temporary loss of baggage. The appellants then appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. In response to these allegations, expert evidence was introduced regarding state practice under international law. However, the admissibility of such evidence has been inconsistent in various courts.\n\nThe key issue in this case is whether standardized compensation under a consumer protection scheme falls within or outside Article 29's scope as an \"action for damages.\" In determining whether a statutory entitlement constitutes an \"action for damages,\" it must be considered if it shares characteristics with judicial proceedings seeking individualized compensation tied to harm caused by another party.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the Air Passenger Protection Regulations do not conflict with the Montreal Convention and are therefore intra vires the Canada Transportation Act. Writing for the majority, Justice Rowe emphasized that the Montreal Convention's exclusivity principle applies only to actions for damages that share characteristics of judicial proceedings in courts of law and seek individualized compensation. The Regulations, on the other hand, create a consumer protection scheme providing for standardized compensation without regard to individual harm or inconvenience.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that airlines can be required to compensate passengers for certain  international flight disruptions.</strong>This is an appeal about whether a federal agency  can require airlines to pay compensation to passengers for certain  international flight disruptions. It addresses whether that compensation is  consistent with a treaty dealing with some aspects of international air travel. In 2018, Parliament amended the <em>Canada Transportation Act</em> (\u201cCTA\u201d) to  require that the Canadian Transportation Agency make regulations establishing  what it described as a \u201cnew air passenger rights regime\u201d. In 2019, the Agency  made the <em>Air Passenger Protection  Regulations</em>. The Regulations say what airlines have to do for passengers in  the case of international flight delays, cancellations and denial of boarding,  which in some cases includes paying a set minimum amount of compensation. They  also require airlines to refund baggage fees paid by passengers when an airline  has lost or damaged their baggage on international flights.The International Air Transport Association, the  Air Transportation Association of America, and several airlines (collectively,  \u201cairlines\u201d) challenged certain provisions of the Regulations before the Federal  Court of Appeal. The airlines said that the provisions were not consistent with  the <em>Convention for the Unification of  Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air</em> (\u201cMontreal Convention\u201d) and  fell outside the Agency\u2019s regulation-making authority under the CTA. The Montreal Convention is an international  agreement that Canada signed in 2001 and that has been implemented into  Canadian law. It sets out certain conditions and limits on what airlines can be  required to pay passengers to compensate for international flight disruptions. Article  29 of the Montreal Convention says that any \u201caction for damages\u201d within the  scope of the agreement is subject to those conditions and limits. This is  called the \u201cexclusivity principle\u201d, because it prevents a person from bringing  an \u201caction for damages\u201d not subject to the conditions and limits even if there  is another basis in law to do so.The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the  challenge brought by the airlines, with the exception of the provisions  relating to the temporary loss of baggage. It considered the compatibility of  the Regulations with the Montreal Convention, and concluded that the  compensation provided for under the Regulations is not an \u201caction for damages\u201d.The Airlines appealed to the Supreme Court  seeking an order setting aside certain provisions of the Regulations as they  relate to international air travel. The Supreme Court has dismissed the Airlines\u2019  appeal.<strong>The  compensation payable to passengers is not individualized and is not therefore an  \u201caction for damages\u201d limited by the Montreal Convention.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Rowe explained  that the Montreal Convention is exclusive within the scope of the matters that  it addresses but does not deal comprehensively with all aspects of  international carriage by air. Under Article 29, there must be an \u201caction\u201d that  leads to \u201cdamages\u201d for the exclusivity principle to apply. However, the  Regulations do not provide for an \u201caction for damages\u201d because they do not  provide for individualized compensation. Rather, they create a consumer  protection scheme that operates in parallel with the Montreal Convention, without  trenching on its liability limitation provisions. Thus, they do not fall within  the scope of the Montreal Convention\u2019s exclusivity principle. Since the  Regulations do not give rise to liability that is pre-empted by Article 29,  they do not conflict with the Montreal Convention and there is no basis to  conclude that they are outside the jurisdiction of the Agency.",

Charles Due to Erroneous Admission of Hearsay Evidence.\n\nThis appeal concerns the admissibility of an out-of-court statement by a Crown witness, K.A., during the trial of the appellant, Yves Caleb Jr. Charles, and whether it meets the twin criteria of necessity and threshold reliability under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay.\n\nThe complainant testified that he had been threatened by the appellant in a school washroom using a fake pistol. Two other students, including K.A., were present at the time. The next day, K.A. was arrested and questioned by police investigators in the presence of his mother and after consulting with counsel. He provided a written statement admitting possession of two pellet pistols belonging to another student, Fares. However, at trial, K.A. claimed to have no recollection of the events, leading the Crown to seek the introduction of his out-of-court statement into evidence through a voir dire.\n\nThe trial judge admitted K.A.'s statement into evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay. The appellant was found guilty on all counts. On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal (QCCA), a majority upheld the trial judge's decision to admit K.A.'s statement into evidence. However, upon further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), the Court allowed the appellant's appeal, quashing his convictions and ordering a new trial.\n\nA critical legal principle established in this case is that corroborative evidence must have a logical connection with each material aspect it seeks to confirm, rather than merely supporting general credibility or guilt. In determining whether corroborative evidence can be used under principle exceptions when it does not relate directly to all material aspects within said statement, one must assess if other related elements provide sufficient connections between them so as to establish trustworthiness via indirect means.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Moreau held that the trial judge erred in admitting the witness's out-of-court statement into evidence under the principled exception to the hearsay rule. The majority found that the search results did not meet the criteria for corroborative evidence set out in R. v. Bradshaw, and that the circumstances surrounding the statement did not support a finding of threshold reliability. Furthermore, they held that relying on the complainant's testimony outside of the voir dire was improper. The decision emphasizes the importance of critically evaluating the reliability of out-of-court statements and ensuring that corroborative evidence is relevant to the specific material facts being proved.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial because of the erroneous admission of an out\u2011of\u2011court  statement at trial.</strong>This appeal concerns  the admissibility in evidence of an out\u2011of\u2011court statement made by a trial witness.Following an incident  involving the accused and the complainant at the school they attended, the  accused was charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm and  uttering threats. At trial, the complainant testified that he had entered a  washroom at the school and had felt something on his hip while washing his  hands. When he turned around, he saw that it was a pistol held by the accused,  being used to threaten him. Two other students were present at the time. One of  them, who testified at the accused\u2019s trial, claimed to have no recollection of  the events. The prosecution therefore requested a <em>voir dire</em>, seeking the admission into evidence of an out\u2011of\u2011court  statement given by that witness to the police investigators the day after the  events. A <em>voir dire</em> is a proceeding  held in the absence of the jury during a criminal trial to allow the judge to consider,  for example, the admissibility of evidence that a party wishes to present. The witness had  been questioned by the police investigators for about an hour and had provided  a written statement. Among other things, the witness admitted in his statement  that he was in possession of two pellet pistols. The police conducted a search  and recovered the pistols at the witness\u2019s residence. The trial judge admitted  the witness\u2019s out\u2011of\u2011court statement into evidence. The judge found that the  only likely explanation for the statement was its truthfulness as to its  material aspects, given the circumstances in which the statement was made and  the seizure of pistols, which the judge considered to be corroborative  evidence. Corroborative evidence is evidence that reinforces other evidence. Following the trial, the  accused was found guilty of the three charges. The judge accepted the  complainant\u2019s version of events, which was supported by a surveillance video  and the witness\u2019s statement. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the trial  judge\u2019s decision to admit the statement into evidence and dismissed the  accused\u2019s appeal. The Supreme  Court of Canada has allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions. The Court  has also ordered a new trial. <strong>The out\u2011of\u2011court statement did not have the  indicia of reliability required to be admitted at trial.</strong>Writing for  the majority of the Court, Justice\u00a0Moreau\u00a0determined that the trial judge had erred  in finding that the witness\u2019s out\u2011of\u2011court statement had the required indicia  of reliability and in admitting the statement into evidence at trial. The  results of the search subsequently conducted at the witness\u2019s residence do not  meet the criteria for corroborative evidence laid down by the Supreme Court in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16702/index.do\">R.  v. Bradshaw</a></em>. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the statement do  not support a finding that threshold reliability is established. Finally, the  majority of the Court of Appeal should not have relied on the complainant\u2019s  testimony, given outside of the <em>voir dire</em>,  to hold that the threshold reliability of the witness\u2019s statement was  established.

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, holding that disgorgement orders, but not administrative penalties, are exempt from discharge under section 178(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.\n\nThis appeal concerns the question of whether administrative penalties and disgorgement orders imposed by the British Columbia Securities Commission (Commission) for market manipulation are exempt from discharge under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA).\n\nThalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian (the Poonians) were found by the Commission to have engaged in market manipulation, causing millions of dollars in losses to investors. The Commission imposed administrative penalties ($13.5 million) and disgorgement orders (approximately $5.6 million) under the Securities Act. The Commission applied for a declaration that these debts not be released by any order of discharge. The Supreme Court of British Columbia allowed the application, finding that the debts were exempt from discharge under sections 178(1)(a) and (e) of the BIA. The Poonians appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which upheld the chambers judge's conclusion that the disgorgement orders came within the section 178(1)(e) exception but held that the debts were not exempt from discharge under section 178(1)(a). The Poonians further appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal in part, holding that neither the administrative penalties nor the disgorgement orders are exempt from discharge under section 178(1)(a). However, the Court found that the disgorgement orders, but not the administrative penalties, are captured by the section 178(1)(e) exception and will not be released by any order of discharge. The Court's decision was based on its interpretation of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the relationship between regulatory penalties, disgorgement orders, and their survivability in bankruptcy.\n\nFor a debt or liability to survive bankruptcy under section 178(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA), the creditor must establish: (1) false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation; (2) a passing of property or provision of services; and (3) a direct link between the debt or liability and the fraud, limiting the non-dischargeable debt or liability to the value of the property or services obtained by deceit.\n\nWriting for the majority, Wagner C.J. and Cote, Rowe, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ. held that the Commission's administrative penalties and disgorgement orders imposed on the bankrupts are not entirely released by an order of discharge under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA). The majority reasoned that while the administrative penalties do not fall within the exceptions set out in sections 178(1)(a) and 178(1)(e) of the BIA, the disgorgement orders do survive bankruptcy under section 178(1)(e). The majority concluded that the words \"imposed by a court\" in section 178(1)(a) do not capture the registration of administrative tribunal or regulatory agency decisions as judgments of a superior court. Additionally, they found that section 178(1)(e) requires a direct link between the creation of the debt or liability and the debtor's deceit, and that the disgorgement orders were made to compel the wrongdoer to give up any ill-gotten amounts obtained as a result of the failure to comply with the Securities Act, thus directly resulting from the debtor's deceitful conduct.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court concludes that bankruptcy does not release people from orders to pay amounts obtained by fraud, but  could release them from administrative penalties.</strong>This appeal is  about whether bankruptcy releases  persons from having to comply with certain orders imposed on them by a regulatory  agency for having broken the law. Bankruptcy is a legal process through which a  person can be released, or discharged, from having to pay certain debts,  subject to conditions.Between 2007 and 2009, Thalbinder  Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian engaged in a scheme in which they manipulated  the share price of a public oil and gas company called OSE Corp. and then sold  the overpriced shares to investors. The scheme caused vulnerable investors to  lose millions of dollars. In 2014, the British Columbia  Securities Commission found that the Poonians had violated the province\u2019s <em>Securities Act</em>. It eventually ordered  them to pay $13.5 million in administrative penalties. Administrative penalties  are consequences for having broken the law that are imposed by administrative  tribunals or regulatory agencies instead of the courts. The Commission also  ordered the Poonians to pay a further $5.6 million, representing the amounts  they had obtained as a result of the scheme. These are called \u201cdisgorgement  orders\u201d. In 2018, the Poonians went into  bankruptcy. Section 178(1) of the federal <em>Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act</em> lists certain debts from which a person is not released  through bankruptcy (debts that are \u201cexempted from discharge\u201d). The Commission asked  the Supreme Court of British Columbia to decide whether the amounts owed to it  by the Poonians would be exempted from discharge, based on this rule. The Supreme Court of British  Columbia said that the orders would be exempted from discharge. It found that  the exceptions in s. 178(1)(a) \u2014 relating to penalties \u201cimposed by a court\u201d \u2014  and in s. 178(1)(e) \u2014 relating to debt that results from \u201cobtaining property or  services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation\u201d \u2014 both applied. The Poonians\u2019 appeal to the Court  of Appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal concluded that although the s.  178(1)(a) exception did not apply because the Commission\u2019s decisions were not  \u201cimposed by a court\u201d, the exception in s. 178(1)(e) did apply. The Poonians  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal in part. It has reversed the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the  administrative penalties are exempted from discharge under s. 178(1)(e), while  upholding its conclusion that the disgorgement orders are exempted.<strong>Orders to pay  amounts that were obtained by fraud are directly linked to that fraud in a way  that administrative penalties are not.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  C\u00f4t\u00e9 held that neither the administrative penalties nor the disgorgement orders  are exempted from discharge pursuant to s. 178(1)(a). The words \u201cimposed by a  court\u201d in s. 178(1)(a) do not capture orders made by administrative tribunals  or regulatory agencies, such as the Commission, that are subsequently  registered as judgments of a court. In addition, the administrative  penalties do not come within the exception in s. 178(1)(e), as they did not  result directly from the fraudulent scheme; rather, they arose indirectly as a  result of the Commission\u2019s decision to sanction the Poonians. The disgorgement  orders, however, are captured by the s. 178(1)(e) exception as there is a  direct link between them and the Poonians\u2019 fraudulent conduct. Therefore, they  will not be released by any possible future order of discharge.",

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds the Honour of the Crown in Ontario (Attorney General) v. Restoule\n\nThis appeal concerns the interpretation of the Robinson-Huron and Robinson-Superior Treaties, specifically the Augmentation Clause, and the obligations of the Crown to the Anishinaabe people.\n\nThe Robinson-Huron and Robinson-Superior Treaties were signed in 1850 between the Anishinaabe people and the Crown, ceding large tracts of land in exchange for a perpetual annuity. The Augmentation Clause provides for the increase of the annuity if the ceded lands produce an amount that would allow the Crown to increase the annuity without incurring loss. The annuity was initially set at $600 for the Robinson-Huron Treaty and $500 for the Robinson-Superior Treaty. The treaties also provided for the creation of reserves for the Anishinaabe people and guaranteed their right to hunt and fish on the ceded land. The Anishinaabe people claimed that the Crown had breached its obligations under the treaties by failing to increase the annuity as required.\n\nThe case was heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, where the trial judge, Hennessy J., ruled that the Crown had a mandatory and reviewable obligation to increase the annuities under the treaties when the economic circumstances permitted. The trial judge also found that the Crown had breached its obligations under the treaties by failing to increase the annuity as required. The case was then appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal in part and dismissed it in part. The Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge had erred in finding that the Crown had a sui generis fiduciary duty to administer the ceded land on behalf of the Anishinaabe people. However, the court also ruled that the Crown had a duty to diligently implement the augmentation clause and that the honour of the Crown required the Crown to increase the annuities beyond $4 per person. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, where the court ruled that the interpretation of historic treaties is reviewable for correctness. The court also found that the Crown had a duty to consider, from time to time, whether it could increase the annuities without incurring loss, and that the Crown's discretion in this regard was not unfettered.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada's decision in this case establishes the principle that the interpretation of historic treaties is reviewable for correctness, and that the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to diligently fulfill its treaty promises.\n\nWriting for the majority, Jamal J. held that the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time, whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. If the Crown can increase the annuities without incurring loss, it must exercise its discretion and decide whether to increase the annuities and, if so, by how much. This discretion is not unfettered; it is to be exercised liberally, justly, and in accordance with the honour of the Crown. The frequency with which the Crown must consider whether it can increase the annuities must also be consistent with the honour of the Crown. Although the Augmentation Clause is not in itself a promise to pay the Anishinaabe a certain sum of money, no party doubts that the Crown was able to increase the annuities beyond $4 per person without incurring loss, and that it should have exercised its discretion to do so. Thus, in the majority's view, the Crown must increase the annuity under the Robinson Treaties beyond $4 per person retrospectively, from 1875 to the present. It would be patently dishonourable not to do so. The majority also concluded that the plaintiffs' breach of treaty claims are not statute-barred by Ontario's limitations legislation. Finally, although no specific fiduciary duties apply in respect of the Augmentation Clause, the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to diligently fulfill this promise. The Crown's ongoing breach of its augmentation promise, in the circumstances, is also a breach of the treaties themselves.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court requires  the Crown to negotiate or, failing agreement, determine the compensation it  owes to First Nations for breaching its treaty promises.</strong>This judgment clarifies the rights  and obligations of the Crown and the Anishinaabe of Lake Huron and Lake  Superior under two historic treaties, and what the Crown must do to address its  breaches of those treaties. In 1850, the Anishinaabe of Lake  Huron and Lake Superior entered into treaties with the Crown, known as the  Robinson Treaties. Under the treaties, the Anishinaabe agreed to cede their  territories to the Crown and the Crown promised to provide in return an annuity  (a perpetual annual payment). The treaties provided for the increase of the  annuities over time under certain circumstances. This part of the treaty, known  as the \u201cAugmentation Clause\u201d, also provided that the amount \u201cpaid to each  individual\u201d each year would not exceed \u00a31 (equivalent to $4), but the Crown had the power to increase it to a higher amount chosen  in its discretion. The annuities  were increased to $4 to each individual in 1875, but have not increased since  then.The Anishinaabe of Lake Superior (\u201cSuperior  plaintiffs\u201d) filed a claim against the Crown in 2001 and the Anishinaabe of  Lake Huron filed their own claim in 2014 (\u201cHuron plaintiffs\u201d). Both plaintiffs alleged  the Crown had breached the Augmentation Clause and its fiduciary duty. Fiduciary  duty means that Canada is obliged to act in the best interest of Indigenous  Peoples. The plaintiffs asked the court to compensate them. The trial judge concluded that,  under the Augmentation Clause, the Crown must increase the annuities when the  economic circumstances warrant it, reflecting a \u201cfair share\u201d of the revenues  received by the Crown from the land. The trial judge said that the honour of  the Crown and a fiduciary duty required the Crown to diligently implement the  Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed from these decisions, arguing that  the trial judge was wrong in her interpretation of the Robinson Treaties. The Court of Appeal allowed Ontario\u2019s appeals in part. The Court of  Appeal agreed that the honour of the Crown applied to the case. A majority of the  Court of Appeal agreed that the Crown is required to increase the annuities  when the economic conditions warrant it, but did not agree that the treaties  promised a fair share of revenues. The Court of Appeal also agreed that the  Crown\u2019s power under the Augmentation Clause to decide whether to increase the  annuities is not unfettered. Unfettered means without any constraints. The  Court of Appeal also found that the Crown was not under a fiduciary duty in  relation to the Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada on a number of issues, including the proper interpretation of the  Augmentation Clause, the nature and content of the Crown\u2019s obligation to give  effect to that clause, and the appropriate remedy for its breach. The Huron and  Superior plaintiffs cross\u2011appealed on the question of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duties. Before the Court, neither  Canada nor Ontario disputed that they are in longstanding breach of the annuity  promises.The Supreme Court has allowed  Ontario\u2019s appeals in part, dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeals,  and issued a declaration about the rights and obligations under the  Augmentation Clause. <strong>An opportunity for negotiation and agreement outside the courtroom has  greater potential to renew the treaty relationship, advance reconciliation, and  restore the honour of the Crown.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Jamal held that  the interpretation of historic Crown-Indigenous treaties is reviewable for  correctness. This means that an appeal court can substitute its interpretation  for that of the lower court if deemed incorrect. Applying this standard of  review to this case, along with the relevant treaty interpretation principles,  Justice Jamal said that the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time,  whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. If the Crown can  increase the annuities beyond $4 to each individual, it must exercise its discretion  and decide whether to do so and, if so, by how much. This discretion is not  unfettered; it must be exercised liberally, justly, and in accordance with the  honour of the Crown. The frequency with which the Crown must consider whether  it can increase the annuities must also be consistent with the honour of the  Crown. Justice Jamal added that, given the longstanding and  egregious nature of the Crown\u2019s breach of the Augmentation Clause, the Crown  must exercise its discretion and increase the annuities with respect to the  past. Having already reached a negotiated settlement concerning past breaches  with the Huron plaintiffs, the Crown is directed to engage in time-bound and  honourable negotiation with the Superior plaintiffs about compensation for past  breaches. Finally, although no specific fiduciary duties apply in respect of  the augmentation promise, the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to  diligently fulfill this promise. ",

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside absolute immunity for the Crown in cases of unconstitutional legislation.\n\nThis appeal concerns the issue of whether damages can be awarded against the Crown for the enactment of legislation that is later declared unconstitutional.\n\nJoseph Power, the respondent, was convicted of two indictable offences in 1996 and served his sentence. He was subsequently denied a record suspension due to transitional provisions in the Limiting Pardons for Serious Crimes Act and the Safe Streets and Communities Act, which were later declared unconstitutional by provincial and federal courts. Power claimed that the changes were unconstitutional and sought damages under section 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Attorney General of Canada conceded that the changes were unconstitutional but argued that the Crown enjoys absolute immunity from damages for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation.\n\nThe motion judge and the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick held that the Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and that damages may be awarded under section 24(1) of the Charter for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation. The Supreme Court of Canada was asked to determine whether the Crown enjoys absolute immunity from damages under section 24(1) of the Charter for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation. The Court ultimately dismissed the appeal, affirming the decisions of the lower courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada held that the state is not entitled to an absolute immunity from liability for damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes Charter rights, but rather enjoys a limited immunity in the exercise of its law-making power, which requires that the law was clearly unconstitutional, or that its enactment was in bad faith or an abuse of power.\n\nWriting for the majority, the Chief Justice and Karakatsanis J. held that the state may be liable for Charter damages if the legislation is clearly unconstitutional or was enacted in bad faith or an abuse of power, striking a balance between the need for effective government and the need to hold the government accountable for infringing Charter rights. The Court's decision provides guidance on the circumstances in which damages may be awarded against the Crown for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation, establishing a high threshold for liability that requires a clear breach of Charter rights or bad faith on the part of the government.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that the state can be required to pay damages for making unconstitutional  legislation in limited circumstances.</strong>This appeal is about whether the state is immune from liability for  damages when it makes legislation that courts later find to be unconstitutional.  Immunity from liability for damages means a situation in which courts cannot  require the payment of such damages.Joseph Power says he applied for  a record suspension in 2013 but his application was denied. A record suspension  allows people who were convicted of a criminal offence, but have completed  their sentence and demonstrated that they are law-abiding citizens, to have  their criminal record kept separate and apart from other criminal records in  some circumstances. Mr. Power says his criminal record prevented him from  working in the field in which he had trained.At the time of Mr. Power\u2019s conviction  in 1996, persons convicted of indictable offences could apply for a record suspension five years  after their release. An indictable offence is a category of more serious criminal  offences. Legislation enacted in 2010 and 2012 rendered Mr. Power permanently ineligible  for a record suspension. This legislation was declared unconstitutional by  courts in other proceedings and the Attorney General of Canada agrees that it violates the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  Mr. Power says he is owed damages under s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter </em>for the breach of his rights caused by the enactment of the  legislation.The Attorney General of Canada asked  the court hearing Mr. Power\u2019s claim to answer two questions. First, can the  state be required to pay damages for governments preparing and drafting a Bill  that later became law, and was subsequently declared unconstitutional? Second,  can the state be required to pay damages for Parliament enacting a Bill into  law, which was later declared unconstitutional?The Court  of Queen\u2019s Bench of New Brunswick answered  \u201cyes\u201d to both questions, finding that the state was entitled to only a limited  immunity from <em>Charter</em> damages for  unconstitutional legislation. The Court of Appeal of New  Brunswick agreed and dismissed the Attorney General of Canada\u2019s  appeal. The Attorney General appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has dismissed the  Attorney General\u2019s appeal.<strong> </strong><strong>The state may be required to pay damages for making  unconstitutional legislation if it is clearly unconstitutional, or was in bad  faith or an abuse of power.</strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice Wagner and Justice Karakatsanis held that the answer to both questions is  \u201cyes\u201d. The state is not entitled to an absolute immunity from liability for  damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes <em>Charter</em> rights. Rather, it may be liable  for <em>Charter </em>damages if the legislation is clearly unconstitutional or  was in bad faith or an abuse of power. An absolute immunity fails to properly  reconcile the constitutional principles that protect legislative autonomy, such  as parliamentary sovereignty and parliamentary privilege, and the principles  that require the government be held accountable for infringing <em>Charter</em> rights, such as  constitutionality and the rule of law. Each of these principles constitutes an  essential part of Canada\u2019s constitutional law and they must all be respected to  achieve an appropriate separation of powers. By shielding the government from  liability in even the most egregious circumstances, absolute immunity would  subvert the principles that demand government accountability. ",

The trial judge found that Mr. Hodgson caused Mr. Winsor's death but acquitted him of second-degree murder and manslaughter, concluding that the Crown failed to establish the requisite subjective mens rea for murder and that Mr. Hodgson's actions were reasonable in the circumstances under the self-defence provisions of the Criminal Code. The Crown appealed the acquittal to the Nunavut Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge erred in law in her analysis of the mens rea for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. Mr. Hodgson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal and restored the acquittal, holding that the trial judge did not commit any errors of law in her assessment of the evidence.

The majority emphasized that the Crown's right to appeal an acquittal is narrow and limited to questions of law alone, and that the Court of Appeal failed to articulate the precise errors of law at the root of its intervention. The majority also concluded that the trial judge did not commit any errors of law in her analysis of the mens rea for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. Specifically, the majority held that the trial judge was not required to accept that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action when assessing the mens rea for murder, and that the trial judge properly considered the objective dangerousness of a chokehold in the context of self-defence. The majority also noted that the common sense inference that sane and sober individuals intend the natural and probable consequences of their actions is a permissive inference, not a presumptive one, and that the trial judge was not bound to draw it.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores  a man\u2019s acquittal because the trial judge committed no errors of law which  would allow the Crown to appeal</strong>This appeal addresses the circumstances in which the Crown can  appeal an acquittal, the accused\u2019s state of mind (or <em>mens rea</em>) required for second degree murder, and the elements  required for self-defence. Mr. Hodgson attended a house party and was asked to help  with removing another guest who refused to leave despite repeated requests to  do so. A physical altercation ensued during which Mr. Hodgson used a chokehold  to restrain the guest, who lost consciousness and died. Mr. Hodgson was charged  with second degree murder.The trial judge found that it was proven beyond a  reasonable doubt that Mr. Hodgson caused the guest\u2019s death by placing him in a  chokehold. However, based on her assessment of the evidence, she acquitted Mr.  Hodgson of second degree murder because the Crown failed to establish the  requisite subjective <em>mens rea. </em>A  second degree murder is a murder that is not planned and deliberate. She also  found Mr. Hodgson not guilty of manslaughter. Manslaughter refers to a homicide  committed as a result of a sudden provocation. The trial judge found that Mr.  Hodgson\u2019s defence of self-defence under s. 34 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>had an air of reality and that the Crown had failed  to establish that the chokehold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal of the  acquittal and directed that a new trial be held on the basis that the trial  judge erred in law in her analysis of the <em>mens  rea</em> for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. Mr.  Hodgson appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and restored  the acquittal.<strong>The Crown\u2019s right of appeal from an acquittal is limited to questions of  law alone.</strong>Writing jointly for the majority,  Justices Martin and Moreau noted that the Crown has a limited right of appeal  on questions of law alone when it seeks to overturn an acquittal. A question of  law is a question of legal interpretation that does not involve an evaluation  of the evidence. In this case, the Court of Appeal did not articulate the  precise errors of law at the root of its intervention and it is not a case in  which the appellate court could reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the  evidence without calling into question the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the  evidence. Furthermore, even if the alleged errors were ones of law, the trial  judge did not commit any such errors. Justices Martin and Moreau said  that an inference that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action is  available in some cases. However, it is not an error of law for a trial judge  to reach a different conclusion about a particular accused\u2019s <em>mens rea</em> based on the evidence. The  Justices found there was no error of law in the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the  evidence on the <em>mens rea</em>. As for self-defence, Justices  Martin and Moreau decided that the trial judge followed the framework set out  in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. That is to say,  the trial judge specifically addressed each of its three elements, correctly  stated the applicable statutory principles, applied them to the facts as found,  and expressed clear conclusions on each element.",

Canada (2024 SCC 24)\n\nThis appeal concerns the jurisdiction of the Federal Court to review assessments made by the Minister under the Excise Tax Act, and whether such assessments can be challenged through judicial review.\n\nIris Technologies Inc., a registrant under the Excise Tax Act (ETA), filed Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns claiming substantial tax refunds for a reporting period ending in 2020. The Minister audited Iris' reporting periods, disallowed input tax credits, and assessed penalties totaling over $24 million. Iris applied for judicial review in Federal Court, seeking declarations that the Minister failed to afford procedural fairness and opportunity to respond to proposed adjustments, that the assessments were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to findings of fact made by the Minister, and that the assessments were made for an improper purpose.\n\nThe prothonotary initially dismissed the Attorney General's motion to strike out Iris' application for judicial review. However, on appeal to a judge of the Federal Court and then to the Federal Court of Appeal, it was held that two claims raised by Iris were properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court as attacks on the correctness of assessments under s. 302 ETA. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately upheld the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal to strike out Iris' application for judicial review.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that when Parliament has established a specialized court for tax appeals (Tax Court), it has ousted the jurisdiction of another court (Federal Court) where an appeal lies from an assessment and is adequate and effective in giving relief sought by a taxpayer.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Kasirer held that the Federal Court of Appeal was correct in striking out Iris Technologies Inc.'s application for judicial review. The majority found that two of Iris' claims - those alleging procedural unfairness and a lack of an evidentiary foundation - were properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court as they were best characterized as attacks on the correctness of the assessment. Furthermore, Iris' third claim, that the Minister acted with an improper purpose, should be struck because Iris did not allege facts in its application that, if true, would give any support to this claim.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that a taxpayer should not challenge tax  assessments by applying to the Federal Court for declarations.</strong>In this appeal, the  Supreme Court dealt with a question of jurisdiction. It determined whether a  taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the validity of tax assessments was a matter within the  exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada or whether it could be brought  in the Federal Court. Iris Technologies  Inc. filed Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns claiming tax refunds under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> (\u201cETA\u201d). The Minister of  National Revenue (the Minister) began an audit of the relevant reporting  periods and refused to pay the refunds while the audit was ongoing. The  Minister then issued an assessment denying the tax refund, and assessed  penalties to be paid by Iris. Iris asked the Federal  Court to review the Minister\u2019s assessment. This kind of request is referred to  as an application for judicial review. Iris also asked the Federal Court to  declare (a) that the Minister failed to afford Iris procedural fairness in the  audit and an opportunity to respond to the proposed adjustments; (b) that the  assessments were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to the  findings of fact made by the Minister; and (c) that the assessments were made  for the improper purpose of seeking to deprive the Federal Court of  jurisdiction in a related application. The Attorney  General of Canada brought a motion to strike Iris\u2019 application for judicial  review. The Case Management Judge dismissed the Attorney General\u2019s motion. The  Attorney General appealed that decision to the Federal Court. The Federal Court  dismissed the Attorney General\u2019s appeal, but the Federal Court of Appeal  allowed its subsequent appeal and struck out Iris\u2019 application for judicial  review on the basis that it was, in essence, a collateral challenge to the  validity of the assessments, a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the  Tax Court. Iris appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The matter  should be brought in the Tax Court of Canada.</strong><strong> </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that notwithstanding the issuance of a tax  assessment, the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to conduct judicial  review over discretionary decisions delegated to the Minister by Parliament,  including those that directly affect liability. However, the Minister\u2019s  assessment of net tax pursuant to the <em>ETA</em> is not the exercise of a discretionary power; it is a non-discretionary  determination where the outcome, the assessment, is dictated by statute. Jurisdiction  over the correctness of the assessment falls to the Tax Court under section 302  of the <em>ETA</em>. In the instant  case, two of the claims raised by Iris in its application for judicial review \u2014  those alleging procedural unfairness and a lack of an evidentiary foundation \u2014  are properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court as they are  best characterized as attacks on the correctness of the assessment. Iris\u2019 third  claim, that the Minister acted with an improper purpose, could, in some  circumstances, be the basis for an application for judicial review, but should  be struck because Iris did not allege facts in its application that, if taken  to be true, would give any support to this claim.

The Minister reassessed Dow Chemical for the 2006 taxation year, applying transfer pricing rules set out in subsection 247(2) of the ITA.

Dow Chemical then sought judicial review of the Minister's decision in the Federal Court and also appealed the reassessment to the Tax Court.\n\nThe Tax Court judge initially held that the Minister's decision under subsection 247(10) of the ITA is an essential component of the taxpayer's assessment and is subject to the Tax Court's exclusive jurisdiction to determine the correctness of the assessment.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to a discretionary decision by the Minister of  National Revenue should be brought in Federal Court. </strong>This appeal addressed  whether the Tax Court of Canada had jurisdiction to consider a company\u2019s challenge  to a decision by the Minister of National Revenue. The Minister refused to reduce the company\u2019s taxable income by adjusting the value of a  \u201cnon-arm\u2019s length\u201d transaction that the company had concluded with a foreign  lender. This procedure is called a downward transfer pricing adjustment. A \u201cnon-arm\u2019s length\u201d  transaction is one in which the parties are related to each other. They can  also be between unrelated individuals, partnerships or corporations, depending  on the circumstances. In contrast, an arm\u2019s length transaction is one in which  both parties act in their separate interests. In the tax context, this  distinction is important because when evaluating a transaction between two  companies that are not at arm\u2019s length, meaning they are associated in some  way, the revenue agency wants to ensure it is still collecting tax on the  transaction at the fair market value. The Canadian  company in question, Dow\u00a0Chemical Canada ULC, concluded a non\u2011arm\u2019s length  loan agreement to borrow money from a related Swiss company. As a result of  this loan agreement, Dow incurred interest expenses for its 2006 and 2007  taxation years. It also reported income for the 2006 taxation year in respect  of manufacturing services provided to the Swiss company. Following a review  of the transactions between Dow and the Swiss company, the Minister reassessed  Dow for its 2006 taxation year, applying transfer pricing rules set out in section  247(2) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> (\u201c<em>ITA</em>\u201d). Under section 247(2), where a  taxpayer is dealing with a non-resident person with whom it is not at arm\u2019s  length \u2013 in this case, the Swiss company \u2013 the amounts in a given transaction  will be adjusted to reflect what would have been agreed to had the persons been  dealing with one another at arm\u2019s length. The application of section 247(2)  resulted in a significant increase in Dow\u2019s income in the 2006 taxation year,  meaning it would need to pay more tax on that income.Dow believed that  its income should be decreased. Where an amount is identified that would  decrease the taxpayer\u2019s income, section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> says that a downward adjustment cannot be made unless approved  by the Minister. Dow asked the Minister to allow a downward transfer pricing  adjustment, but the Minister exercised her discretion to refuse Dow\u2019s request. Dow then asked the  Federal Court to review the Minister\u2019s decision. This process is called a  \u201cjudicial review\u201d. Dow also objected to the reassessment for the 2006 taxation  year and eventually appealed the reassessment to the Tax Court.Dow\u2019s appeal asked  whether the Minister\u2019s denial of the request for a downward transfer pricing  adjustment fell outside the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Tax Court. The  Tax Court said that the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is an essential component of the taxpayer\u2019s assessment and goes to the  correctness of that assessment, and may therefore be reviewed by the Tax Court  under its exclusive jurisdiction to determine, on appeal, the correctness of  the assessment. The Minister disagreed and appealed to the Federal Court of  Appeal. The Federal Court  of Appeal allowed the Minister\u2019s appeal and held that the Federal Court has  exclusive jurisdiction to conduct a judicial review of the Minister\u2019s discretionary  decisions under section 247(10). Dow appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The Tax Court did not have jurisdiction to  review the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that when the Minister has exercised her  discretion under section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> to deny a taxpayer\u2019s request for a downward pricing adjustment, that decision  falls outside of the jurisdiction of the Tax Court in respect of an appeal of  the taxpayer\u2019s assessment. The Minister\u2019s discretionary decision is not part of  the assessment. The meaning of \u201cassessment\u201d is settled in law, and the  Minister\u2019s opinion formed under section 247(10) is qualitatively distinct from  that concept. As there is no express right of appeal to the Tax Court, the  proper forum to challenge the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is the Federal Court, pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction in judicial review  under section 18(1) of the <em>Federal Courts  Act</em>. Only the Federal Court has the jurisdiction to apply the appropriate  standard of review and access to the appropriate range of administrative law  remedies.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules  that Ontario public school board teachers are protected from unreasonable  search and seizure in the workplace under the Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms.</strong>This appeal dealt with the  question of whether the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms </em>(the <em>Charter</em>)  applies to Ontario public school boards. Two teachers employed  by an Ontario public school board recorded their private communications  regarding workplace concerns on a shared personal, password-protected log stored  in the cloud. The school principal, who had been made aware of the log, entered the  classroom of one of the teachers to return some teaching materials after  classes had ended. The teacher was not present. The principal noticed that the Board laptop used by the teacher  was open and touched its mousepad. He saw the log that opened on the screen,  read what was visible, then scrolled through the document and took screenshots  with his cellphone. These communications then formed the basis for the school  board to issue written reprimands. \u00a0 The teachers\u2019 union filed a  grievance against the written reprimands issued to the teachers, claiming that  the search violated the teachers\u2019 right to privacy at work. They did not allege  any breach of the <em>Charter</em>. A labour  arbitrator, appointed pursuant to the collective agreement, dismissed the  grievance. The arbitrator found there was no breach of the teachers\u2019 reasonable  expectation of privacy when balanced against the school board\u2019s interest in  managing the workplace.The teachers\u2019 union asked the Divisional  Court to review the arbitrator\u2019s decision. A majority of the Divisional Court held  that the arbitrator\u2019s decision was reasonable. It said that the school  principal\u2019s search did not raise any <em>Charter </em>issues because, unlike in a criminal context, an employee does not have the  right under section of the <em>Charter</em> to  be secure against unreasonable search or seizure in a workplace environment. The teachers\u2019 union appealed to  the Ontario Court of Appeal, which unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed  the arbitrator\u2019s decision. It held that the majority of the Divisional Court made  a mistake in concluding that section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> did not apply. The Court of Appeal held that  school boards are subject to the <em>Charter</em> and that the school principal\u2019s search was unreasonable under section 8. The school  board then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The  Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The <em>Charter </em>applies to Ontario public  school boards. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Rowe said Ontario public school board teachers are protected by section 8 of  the <em>Charter</em> in the workplace, as  these boards are inherently governmental for the purposes of section 32 of the <em>Charter</em>. Section 32 identifies certain  entities that are bound by the <em>Charter</em>,  including federal and provincial legislatures and governments, as well as  entities that are controlled by a government or that perform governmental  functions. Consequently, the grievance at issue implicated an alleged violation  of a <em>Charter </em>right, and section 8 of  the<em> Charter</em> was a legal constraint  bearing on the arbitrator\u2019s analysis. On review, applying the correctness  standard, the arbitrator erred by limiting her inquiry to the arbitral  framework without regard for the legal framework under section that, as a  matter of law, she was required to respect. This error was fatal and the  arbitrator\u2019s decision should be set aside. For these reasons, Justice Rowe dismissed  the appeal. ",

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the Quebec Court of Appeal's order sealing the entire appeal record in a case involving a police informer.\n\nThis appeal revolves around the delicate balance between the open court principle and informer privilege in the context of a criminal proceeding, specifically whether the Quebec Court of Appeal erred in upholding confidentiality orders that sealed information related to a police informer's identity.\n\nA police informer, referred to as \"Named Person,\" was charged with criminal offenses under the Criminal Code. The accused brought a motion for a stay of proceedings based on abusive state conduct, which was heard in camera to protect the accused's anonymity. The trial judge dismissed the motion, and Named Person was subsequently convicted. On appeal, the Quebec Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, stayed the conviction, and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground of abuse of process by the state. However, the Court of Appeal's decision to seal the entire appeal record, including the trial judgment, was challenged by media organizations and the Attorney General of Quebec.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada heard appeals from the Quebec Court of Appeal's decision to uphold the confidentiality orders. The appellants argued that the Court of Appeal erred in refusing to partially unseal the appeal record and make a redacted version of the trial judgment public. The Supreme Court considered the importance of the open court principle, the scope of informer privilege, and the guiding rule from Named Person v. Vancouver Sun. The Court ultimately allowed the appeals in part, remanding the case to the Quebec Court of Appeal to make public a redacted version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting the parties concerned on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that when proceeding in camera to protect a police informer's identity, courts must apply the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun, which requires them to minimize impairment of the open court principle, and consider creating a parallel proceeding to disclose at least a minimum amount of information to interested third parties, while ensuring the informer's anonymity is protected.\n\nWriting for the majority, the Chief Justice held that the appeals should be allowed in part. The Court found that no secret trial was held in the case, and the magnitude of the controversy that arose could have been limited if the Court of Appeal had not used the expression \"secret trial\" to describe what were actually in camera hearings held in a proceeding that began and initially moved forward publicly. The Court emphasized the importance of rigorously applying the guiding rule from Named Person v. Vancouver Sun, requiring a court to protect informer privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open court principle. The Court's decision highlights the need for a balanced approach in protecting both the anonymity of police informers and the open court principle, ensuring that justice is administered openly and transparently while safeguarding the interests of all parties involved.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that no secret trial  was held in a case involving a person with police informer status.</strong>A person who acted as an informer  for a police force was charged with criminal offences. The person brought a  motion for a stay of proceedings based in part on abusive state conduct related  to the laying of the charges. Because the person\u2019s informer status was at the  centre of the relevant factual context and the parties\u2019 arguments, the judge  dealing with the motion ordered that it be heard <em>in\u00a0camera</em>, that is, in private. No notice was given to the  media, since the judge was of the view that revealing anything about the  motion, including its existence, would be likely to compromise the person\u2019s  anonymity. The motion, its content and the exhibits and transcripts submitted  to the judge remained confidential and were not in any court record. The motion  was dismissed in a written judgment, which had no file number and could not be  consulted by the public.The person was subsequently  convicted and appealed the conviction. The appeal was heard <em>in\u00a0camera</em>, and no notice was given  to the media. The Court of Appeal allowed the person\u2019s appeal, stayed the  conviction and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground of  abuse of process by the state. The Court of Appeal decided to open a record at its  court office, accompanied by a sealing order, and to make public a version of  its decision in which certain information was redacted, that is, blacked out.  In that decision, the Court of Appeal denounced the holding of a \u201csecret  trial\u201d, which alarmed the public and the media. It also expressed its  disagreement with the scope of the confidentiality measures put in place for  the person\u2019s trial.A number of media organizations,  the Attorney General of Quebec and the Chief Judge of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec then  asked the Court of Appeal to review the confidentiality orders made in this  case. In a second decision, the Court of Appeal upheld the sealing of all  information that might tend to identify the person. The Court of Appeal also  refused to partially unseal, or open up, the appeal record by redacting the  same information as in the public version of its decision. The media  organizations and the Attorney General of Quebec appealed that second decision  to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has allowed  their appeals in part.<strong>Court openness is a cardinal principle of the Canadian justice system. Any exception to this principle must be limited.</strong>In a unanimous judgment, the  Court confirmed that no secret trial was held in this case. The Court in fact specified  that \u201cthe very concept of \u2018secret trial\u2019 does not exist in Canada.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  [T]he  cardinal principle of court openness may be tempered where the circumstances of  a case so require. Various confidentiality orders may be made\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.,  up to and including an order that all hearings be held <em>in\u00a0camera</em>\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But it is well established that  \u2018secret trials\u2019, those that leave no trace, are not part of the range of  possible measures.\u201d According to the Supreme Court,  the magnitude of the controversy that arose after the Court of Appeal\u2019s first decision  was released could have been limited if that court had not used the expression  \u201csecret trial\u201d to describe what were actually <em>in\u00a0camera</em> hearings held in a proceeding that began and  initially moved forward publicly.Where, as in this case, an informer asserts their status in a proceeding  that began publicly in which they face charges that do not cause them to lose  their status, and the informer\u2011police relationship is central to the  proceedings, the appropriate way to protect the informer\u2019s anonymity will  generally be to proceed totally <em>in\u00a0camera</em>.  Even in these most confidential of cases, it is still possible \u2014 and even  essential \u2014 to protect the informer\u2019s anonymity while favouring confidentiality  orders that do not entirely or indefinitely keep the existence of a hearing or  judgment from the public. What is in issue is the maintenance of public  confidence in the administration of justice and compliance with the guiding  rule from <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2384/index.do\">Named  Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43</a></em>, which requires a court to protect informer  privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open  court principle.As the Supreme Court noted, when  justice is rendered in secret, without leaving any trace, respect for the rule  of law is jeopardized and public confidence in the administration of justice  may be shaken. The open court principle allows a society to guard against such  risks, which erode the very foundations of democracy. By ensuring the  accountability of the judiciary, court openness supports an administration of  justice that is impartial, fair and in accordance with the rule of law. It also  helps the public gain a better understanding of the justice system and its  participants, which can only enhance public confidence in their integrity.  Court openness is therefore of paramount importance to our democracy \u2014 an  importance that is also reflected in the constitutional protection afforded to  it in Canada. In this case, the Supreme Court found  that the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the motions for disclosure of  the information that had been kept confidential up to that time but that it erred  in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. The case is  therefore remanded to the Court of Appeal so that it can make public a redacted  version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting  the parties concerned on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction.",

(the buyer) entered into a contract with Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc. (the seller) to purchase topsoil with a specified composition for a municipal project. However, due to delays and the risk of liquidated damages, the buyer waived its right to test and approve the topsoil before delivery. The contract contained exclusion clauses stating that the seller would not be responsible for the quality of the topsoil if the buyer waived its right to test it before shipment. When the topsoil was found to have a different composition than promised, the buyer claimed damages against the seller. The buyer alleged that the seller breached the implied condition of correspondence with description under section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) by delivering topsoil that did not meet the specified composition requirements.\n\nAt trial, the judge found that the contract was a sale by description within the meaning of section 14 of the SGA and that the buyer did not receive the topsoil it bargained for. However, the judge also ruled that the exclusion clauses operated to insulate the seller from liability under section 14 of the SGA. The Ontario Court of Appeal (OCA) reversed the trial judge's decision, holding that there was no express agreement to exclude the statutory condition of correspondence with description. The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) allowed the appeal, upholding the trial judge's ruling that the exclusion clauses in the contract were sufficient to exempt the seller from liability for the quality of the material.\n\nThe key legal principle established by the court is that the interpretation of exclusion clauses must be approached in a flexible, practical, and common-sense way, taking into account the surrounding circumstances and the objective intention of the parties.\n\nWriting for the majority, Wagner C.J. held that the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion clauses at issue. The objective meaning of the parties' express agreement is that the buyer accepted the risk that the topsoil would not meet the previously supplied specifications concerning its composition if it failed to test what it knew was an organic and changing substance. The court found that the parties' contract contained a valid exclusion clause that exempted the seller from liability for the quality of the topsoil if the buyer waived its right to test the material before it left the seller's facility. This decision highlights the importance of considering the surrounding circumstances and the objective intention of the parties in interpreting exclusion clauses, and it emphasizes the need for a flexible and balanced approach to the interpretation of exclusion clauses in contracts.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies what is required for an exclusion  clause in a contract of sale to exempt the seller from an implied condition  under Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. </strong>This appeal concerned a party\u2019s ability to contract out of an  implied condition of sale under Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale  of Goods Act</em>. Implied conditions are obligations that are automatically  incorporated into a contract unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. The  Supreme Court clarified what was required to show that the parties expressly  agreed to contract out of the implied condition.\u00a0\u00a0 Pine Valley  Enterprises Inc. was hired by the City of Toronto to work on a municipal  project to remediate flooding, which included the removal and replacement of  topsoil for drainage. Pine Valley contacted Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc., a  topsoil provider, to obtain topsoil with a specified composition. Earthco provided  Pine Valley with laboratory reports from different topsoil samples taken about  six weeks prior, and warned against purchasing the topsoil without updated test  results. \u00a0However, Pine Valley had  already missed project deadlines and urgently wanted delivery of the topsoil to  avoid a financial penalty. Pine Valley therefore insisted on immediate  delivery. Pine Valley and Earthco agreed to add two exclusion clauses to their  contract that stated that Pine Valley had the right to test and approve the  material before it was shipped, and that if it waived those rights, Earthco  would not be responsible for the quality of the material once it left its  facility. After the  topsoil was delivered and placed on the project site, water ponding was noted. New  testing revealed that there was substantially more clay in the topsoil than the  initial test results had indicated, and Pine Valley had to remove and replace  the topsoil. Pine Valley then sued Earthco for damages, alleging that it did  not receive topsoil within the range of compositional properties that had been  indicated in the initial test results.The trial judge  dismissed Pine Valley\u2019s action. He found that the contract was for a sale of  goods by description within the meaning of section 14 of Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which sets out an  implied condition that goods must correspond with their description. He agreed  that Pine Valley did not get the topsoil it bargained for, because of the  variation between the topsoil that was promised and the topsoil that was  delivered. However, the trial judge concluded that the exclusion clauses met  the requirements of an \u201cexpress agreement\u201d according to section 53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which allows parties to  contract out of the implied condition under section 14. He concluded as such  despite the fact that the exclusion clauses did not explicitly mention that  they were added to the contract for this purpose. \u00a0The Court of  Appeal disagreed with the trial judge and found that the wording in the  exclusion clauses was insufficient to exempt Earthco from liability under section  14 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. The  Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a judgment requiring Earthco  to pay damages. Earthco appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal.<strong>The exclusion clauses were an express agreement  pursuant to section 53. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin said that to be sufficient for the purposes of section  53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, an  \u201cexpress agreement\u201d must be comprised of an agreement to negative or vary a  statutorily implied right, duty or liability and such an agreement must be  expressly set forth within the parties\u2019 contract. The determination as to what  qualifies as an express agreement must also be informed by principles of  contractual interpretation and the law concerning exclusion clauses, and the  paramount consideration must be the objective intention of the parties. In the instant  case, the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion  clauses at issue. The objective meaning of the parties\u2019 express agreement was that  Pine Valley accepted the risk that the topsoil would not meet the previously  supplied specifications concerning its composition if it failed to test what it  knew was an organic and changing substance. For these reasons, Justice Martin  allowed the appeal and restored the trial judge\u2019s judgment. ",

T.W.W.\n\nThis appeal involves the use of prior sexual activity evidence in a sexual assault trial and raises questions about the admissibility of such evidence and the limits of court openness.\n\nThe complainant and the accused, T.W.W., were in a romantic relationship for over 20 years before separating in February 2018. The accused was charged with sexual assault against the complainant on April 2, 2018. He applied to adduce evidence of consensual intercourse between himself and the complainant on the evening of April 1, 2018, as part of his defence, pursuant to sections 276 and 278.93 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge dismissed the application, and the accused was subsequently convicted of sexual assault. The accused appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the evidence of prior sexual activity.\n\nThe accused's appeal process involved multiple levels of court proceedings. The trial judge initially dismissed the application to adduce evidence of prior sexual activity, finding that it was not relevant to the issue of consent on April 2 and that it would invoke twin-myth reasoning. The accused appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which upheld the trial judge's decision. The accused further appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada as of right. Meanwhile, the Crown brought a motion requesting orders to protect information covered by sections 276 and 278.93-278.95 regarding the appeal process. The Court considered the source of its authority to limit court openness on appeals of section 276 proceedings and ultimately determined that section 278.95 of the Criminal Code does not extend to the appeal process. However, the Court found that it had the implied jurisdiction to make orders limiting court openness derived from its jurisdiction to control its own processes and records.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada established the principle that evidence of prior sexual activity may be admissible in a sexual assault trial if it is not used to support twin-myth reasoning and if its probative value is not substantially outweighed by prejudicial effect. The accused bears the burden of establishing a specific use for this information that is permitted by the s. 276 regime and that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice OBonsawin held that the trial judge did not err in denying the application to introduce prior sexual activity evidence under sections 276 and 278.93 of the Criminal Code. The appellant failed to identify a specific use for the evidence that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and was essential to his ability to make full answer and defence. The majority also held that the mandatory publication ban under section 278.95 of the Criminal Code does not extend to appellate proceedings, but the Court has implied jurisdiction to make orders limiting court openness. However, the Crown's motion to restrict publication and hold the hearing in camera was only partially allowed, with the Court imposing a publication ban on any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity other than that which forms the subject-matter of the charge.",

However, in an earlier statement to the police, the complainant also  stated that she and the accused had engaged in consensual sexual activity on  the evening of April 1, the night before the sexual assault. Prior to his trial, the accused asked the court to  allow evidence that he and the complainant had engaged in consensual sexual  activity in the evening of April 1 and in the morning of April 2. He argued  that admitting such evidence would serve to challenge the complainant\u2019s  credibility \u2013 specifically with respect to her claim that the marriage had  completely broken down at the time of the alleged assault \u2013 to provide context,  and to support his defence that the complainant had consented to the sexual  activity, as it was all part of one interaction. Under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual activity with the  accused or with any other person is not admissible to support an inference that  the complainant is either (a) more likely to have consented to the sexual  activity at the center of the charge; or (b) is less worthy of belief. In law,  this is called \u201ctwin-myth reasoning\u201d and relying on such inferences is not  allowed.The trial judge dismissed the accused\u2019s application to  admit this evidence. He found no inconsistency between the complainant\u2019s  statement to the police and her testimony. In his view, the evidence the accused  wanted to submit was irrelevant to her credibility \u2013 it would only serve to  support one of the two inferences prohibited under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. As required under section  278.95 of the <em>Criminal </em>Code, the  content of the accused\u2019s application, the hearing that was held to decide the  issue and the trial judge\u2019s decision were subject to a publication ban. The  case went to trial and the accused was ultimately convicted. The accused\u2019s appeal proceeded <em>in camera </em>(closed to the public) and the appeal record was sealed  (not made public). A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia  dismissed the accused\u2019s appeal. It agreed with the trial judge that the accused  had not identified a legitimate use of the proposed evidence. The accused then appealed the decision to the Supreme  Court of Canada. By way of a motion, the Crown relied on section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to ask the Court for an <em>in camera </em>hearing, for filed materials  to be sealed, and for any other order necessary to protect information and  evidence related to the accused\u2019s application to admit evidence on prior sexual  activity. The Court heard oral arguments on the motion before continuing with  the hearing on the appeal. The Supreme Court has dismissed the accused\u2019s appeal  and allowed the Crown\u2019s motion in part. \u00a0\u00a0<strong>The evidence of prior sexual activity was inadmissible at the trial.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin held that the accused failed to  sufficiently identify a specific use for the prior sexual activity evidence  that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and that was essential to his ability  to make full answer and defence. The trial judge did not make a mistake in  denying the application. As such, the accused\u2019s conviction was upheld. With respect to the Crown\u2019s motion, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin determined  that the mandatory publication ban under section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>did not extend to  appellate proceedings. Rather, she said the Supreme Court\u2019s power to make an  order limiting court openness in the instant case was derived from implied  jurisdiction of courts to control their own processes and records. The Court\u2019s  discretion should be exercised in a way that maintains court openness as far as  practicable while protecting the complainant\u2019s personal dignity and privacy and  the accused\u2019s fair trial rights.Justice O\u2019Bonsawin then applied the test set out in <a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2021/38695-eng.pdf\"><em>Sherman Estate v. Donovan</em></a>, a prior unrelated  decision of this Court, to conclude that the circumstances of the instant case  did not justify all of the measures requested by the Crown. Banning publication  of any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity  other than that which formed the subject-matter of the charge was  sufficient.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ",

Lozada\n\nThis appeal concerns the central legal question of whether the trial judge's instructions on causation in the context of co-principal liability for manslaughter were adequate.\n\nRameez Khalid was involved in a physical altercation with two groups of people, including Emanuel Lozada and Victor Ramos, which resulted in Mr. Khalid being stabbed twice, once in the abdomen and fatally through the heart. The accused did not inflict the fatal stab wound, and there was no evidence that they knew or foresaw that anyone in their group had a knife or that Mr. Khalid would be stabbed. The accused were convicted of manslaughter under sections 21(1)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code, with the Crown advancing two theories of party liability. The accused appealed their convictions, claiming that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury on causation in the context of co-principal liability.\n\nThe trial judge instructed the jury on the issue of causation, explaining that the appellants' conduct must be a significant contributing cause of the victim's death. The judge also discussed the concept of reasonable foreseeability, stating that the continuation of assaults on the victim and the risk of non-trivial bodily harm may be enough to establish legal causation. The jury was satisfied that the appellants' actions were a significant contributing cause of the victim's death, and they were convicted of manslaughter. On appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals, finding that the trial judge's instructions were accurate and sufficient. However, the dissenting judge would have allowed the appeals and ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge's instructions on causation were inadequate. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately dismissed the appeals, upholding the manslaughter convictions.\n\nThe most critical legal principle established by the court is that in cases involving co-principal liability for manslaughter under s. 21(1)(a), where an intervening act may have broken the chain of causation between an accused's acts and a victim's death, it must be determined whether such intervening act was reasonably foreseeable or flowed reasonably from an accused's conduct; however, what must be reasonably foreseeable is not merely further non-trivial bodily harm but rather its general nature and accompanying risk.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Moreau held that the trial judge's instructions on causation in the context of co-principal liability were accurate and properly equipped the jury to decide the case according to the law and the evidence. The majority found that the trial judge's instructions conveyed the correct overall test for legal causation, which is whether the accused's unlawful acts were a significant contributing cause of death. The majority also held that the trial judge properly instructed the jury on the issue of intervening acts, including the possibility that an act of a co-participant in a group assault can trigger the application of the intervening act doctrine. The majority concluded that the appeals should be dismissed.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  the convictions of two men guilty of manslaughter.</strong>The issue in these appeals  was whether the trial judge made a mistake in instructing the jury on how to  establish causation between the accused\u2019s unlawful acts and the victim\u2019s death from  stabbing wounds inflicted by a third person. Emanuel Lozada and Victor  Ramos were accused of manslaughter as a result of an unlawful act (known in law  as \u201cunlawful act manslaughter\u201d) after participating in a fight in downtown  Toronto, which resulted in the fatal stabbing of a victim. It was never  suggested that either Mr. Lozada or Mr. Ramos had stabbed the victim. A third person  was convicted of second degree murder for the stabbing. Rather, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos were accused of acting as co-principals in the fatal attack or aiders  and abettors to the stabber. To convict Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos, the Crown needed to establish causation between their unlawful acts \u2013  their participation in the group assault \u2013 and the victim\u2019s death. To do so,  the Crown had to prove that the unlawful acts were a significant contributing  cause to his death. The Crown\u2019s theory was that Mr. Ramos fought with the  victim and punched or kicked him, while Mr. Lozada fought with one of the  victim\u2019s friends. It argued that the two men\u2019s assaults left the victim  vulnerable to being stabbed by the third man. In their defence, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos argued that the stabbing was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence  of their decision to join a fight. As such, the stabbing event broke the chain  of causation between their assaults and the victim\u2019s death and they could not  be held criminally responsible for it. The jury convicted Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos of unlawful act manslaughter. The two men appealed their  convictions together at the Ontario Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial  judge made a mistake when instructing the jury on whether their conduct was a  significant contributing cause of the victim\u2019s death. The majority of the Court  of Appeal dismissed their appeals. It found that when considered in isolation,  two passages from the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on reasonable  foreseeability misstated the law. However, the majority concluded that read as  a whole, the instructions given by the trial judge to the jury were accurate. Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeals.<strong>The jury was accurately instructed on the issue of causation.</strong>Writing for the majority,  Justice Moreau said that on a reading of the jury instructions and the trial  judge\u2019s answers to the jury\u2019s questions as a whole, the instructions conveyed  the proper test for causation: whether the conduct of Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos  was a significant contributing cause of the victim\u2019s death. Moreover, the trial  judge properly equipped the jury with appropriate analytical tools \u2013 i.e. the  question of reasonable foreseeability \u2013 to assist the jury in determining  whether the stabbing could be considered to be an intervening act that would  absolve Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos of legal responsibility for manslaughter. For  these reasons, Justice Moreau dismissed the appeals and upheld the manslaughter  convictions. \u00a0",

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the decision of the Court of Appeal for Newfoundland and Labrador, restoring the application judge's order that compensation for the constructive expropriation of a property should be determined with reference to existing zoning regulations.\n\nThis appeal revolves around the issue of whether zoning regulations should be taken into account when assessing compensation for expropriated property.\n\nThe respondents, members of the Lynch family, own a 7.36-acre property in the Broad Cove River watershed near St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. The property was originally granted to their grandfather in 1917 for forestry purposes but has remained largely undeveloped since then. The City of St. John's has historically regulated land use in the watershed to protect its water supply. In 1992, a municipal reorganization extended the City's boundaries to include the Lynches' property. A new city-wide plan and development regulations were prepared for the entire city in 1994, which included a Watershed zone encompassing the Lynches' property with discretionary uses limited to agriculture, forestry, and public utility purposes. Since at least the 1990s, the Lynches have sought permission from various authorities to develop their property but have been consistently refused due to concerns about protecting water quality in accordance with section 104(4) of City of St. John's Act R.S.N.L., c.C-17.\n\nThe Court of Appeal declared that the property had been constructively expropriated and that the family had a right to file a claim for compensation with the City. The Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities referred a question to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador regarding whether compensation should be assessed based on permitted uses under existing zoning or whether those uses should be ignored. The application judge concluded that compensation assessment should take into account existing zoning regulations as they were an independent enactment not part of an expropriation scheme. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from this decision, ordering that respondents' compensation be determined without reference to existing watershed zoning in Development Regulations. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal from this judgment, restoring the application judge's order.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that, in determining whether a regulation's effect on a property's value should be ignored for compensation purposes, the key question is whether the enactment was made with a view to the expropriation or, conversely, was an independent enactment.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Martin held that the City of St. John's' (City) appeal should be allowed and the application judge's order restored. The court determined that the respondents are entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair compensation for the City's constructive expropriation of their property. The market value assessment for the property must take into account its limited uses due to zoning regulations. The court applied the Pointe Gourde principle, which states that changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are to be ignored in assessing compensation. However, this principle does not exclude all enactments affecting a property's value; rather, it only excludes those made with a view to expropriation. The court ultimately concluded that there was no basis to interfere with the application judge's conclusion that the Watershed zoning was part of an independent zoning regulation and not part of the expropriation scheme.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies  how zoning regulations and other restrictions on land use affect how owners of  expropriated property are compensated. \u00a0</strong>Expropriation is a forcible acquisition by the Crown  of privately-owned property for public purposes. A \u201cconstructive expropriation\u201d  happens when a public authority acquires private property by using its  regulatory powers. In such cases, the owners can be entitled to compensation  based on the property\u2019s market value. At issue in this case was the Lynch family\u2019s property  in the Broad Cove River watershed in Newfoundland. Groundwater within the  watershed drains towards the Broad Cove River, which is used by the City of St.  John\u2019s for the local water supply. Pursuant to the <em>City of St. John\u2019s Act</em>, the Lynch property is subject to the City\u2019s  pollution control and expropriation powers. In 1994, the Lynch property was  zoned as watershed (the \u201cwatershed zoning\u201d). Within the watershed zone, the  City\u2019s permission is required for any use of the land, and it may only be  granted for three discretionary uses: agriculture, forestry and public utility. Since at least the 1990s, the Lynch family has tried  to obtain permission to develop the property. In 2013, the City rejected a  formal application to develop a residential subdivision on the property, citing  its authority under the <em>City of St.  John\u2019s Act </em>and the property\u2019s designation as part of the watershed zone. Following  that refusal, the Lynch family turned to the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of  Appeal, which declared that the City had expropriated the Lynch property when it  refused to permit any development on it. The court\u2019s decision meant that the  Lynch family was entitled to compensation from the City. The City asked the Board of Commissioners of Public  Utilities to assess how much the Lynch family was owed. In turn, the Board  sought the opinion of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador to  determine whether compensation should be assessed based on the watershed zoning  or whether the watershed zoning should be ignored and the value determined as  if residential development were allowed. This question was important because  valuation according to the watershed zoning would diminish the market value of  the property compared to the Lynch family\u2019s desire to use it for residential  development. As a result, taking the watershed zoning into account would reduce  the compensation owed to the Lynch family.The judge applied a legal principle according to which  changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are ignored in  the compensation assessment. As such, the question became whether the watershed  zoning was made with a view to expropriating the Lynch property. The judge ruled  that the watershed zoning was an independent enactment and not part of the  expropriation scheme. This meant that it could operate to influence the market  value of the Lynch property and was not to be ignored for the purpose of  determining compensation. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal allowed  the Lynch family\u2019s appeal. It disagreed with the first judge and concluded that  the watershed zoning was connected to the expropriation. As such, it ordered  the Board to determine compensation without reference to the watershed zoning. The  City appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.\u00a0 <strong>The watershed  zoning was independent from the expropriation scheme. </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Martin held  that the Lynch family was entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair  compensation for the City\u2019s constructive expropriation of the property. She  agreed with the first judge\u2019s finding that the watershed zoning was an  independent enactment and not made with a view to expropriation. As such,  Justice Martin determined that the market value assessment for the property  must take into account the fact that the watershed zoning limits use of the  property to discretionary agriculture, forestry and public utility. To ignore  the watershed zoning would compensate the Lynch family for something they never  would have had absent the expropriation: unencumbered land to develop  residential housing. For these reasons, Justice Martin allowed the appeal, set  aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restored the first judge\u2019s order. ",

The provision also requires the judge before whom the accused first appears to ensure that the accused is advised of their right to apply for a trial before a judge or jury who speak the official language of their choice. In this case, the judge failed to inform the accused of his right to a trial in French, contrary to the requirements of section 530(3) of the Criminal Code.\n\nThe Supreme Court of British Columbia heard the original trial, and the accused was convicted of sexual assault.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial in French for an accused person who was not informed  of his right to be tried in the official language of his choice.\u00a0 </strong>This case was about the  analytical framework that a court of appeal must apply when an accused person appeals  their conviction because they were not informed of their right to be tried in  the official language of their choice the first time they appeared before a  judge, where no decision on their language rights was made at first instance.Section\u00a0530 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>guarantees to every  accused person the right to be tried in the official language of their choice. To  make certain that the accused\u2019s choice is free and informed, section\u00a0530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> imposes a duty on the  judge before whom the accused first appears to ensure that the accused is  advised of their right and of the time before which they must apply for a trial  before a judge or a judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official  language of their choice.Franck Yvan Tayo Tompouba is a  bilingual Francophone who was convicted of sexual assault following a trial  conducted in English in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. During the  judicial process leading to Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba\u2019s conviction, the judge did  not ensure that he was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to  the requirements of section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>. Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba did not apply for a trial in French or  raise the breach of his right to be advised of his right to make such an  application.Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba appealed  his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. It was then that he asserted  for the first time that he would have liked his trial to be conducted in French.  Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba alleged that his language rights had been violated due,  among other things, to the fact that the judge had breached his duty under  section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed his  appeal. While it was of the view that the judge\u2019s breach was an error of law  that warranted its intervention, it found that the evidence did not make it  possible to decide certain key questions, including when Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba  had learned of his fundamental right, whether he would in fact have chosen a  trial in French if he had had an opportunity to do so, and whether he had not  made a free and informed choice to have a trial in English. It therefore found  that the evidence was insufficient and that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba had not met  the burden of persuading it that the judge\u2019s breach of the duty set out in section\u00a0530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> had resulted in a violation  of his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba appealed  the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, which has allowed his appeal.<strong>The Court of Appeal erred in imposing on Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba the  burden of proving that his fundamental right had been violated at first  instance.\u00a0 </strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice\u00a0Wagner stated that section\u00a0530(3) imposes a two\u2011pronged  informational duty on the judge before whom an accused first appears: to ensure  that the accused is duly informed of their fundamental right and of how it is  to be exercised, and, where the circumstances so require, to take the necessary  steps to inform the accused of this.  Chief Justice Wagner affirmed that a breach of this informational duty is an  error of law warranting appellate intervention under section\u00a0686(1)(a) of  the <em>Code</em>. As he explained, this  breach, once established, taints the trial court\u2019s judgment and gives rise to a  presumption that the accused\u2019s fundamental right to be tried in the official  language of their choice, which is guaranteed to the accused by section\u00a0530  of the <em>Code</em>, was violated. The Crown  can then rebut this presumption for the purposes of the analysis under the  curative proviso in section\u00a0686(1)(b)(iv) of the <em>Code</em>, which allows a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal where an  error or irregularity shown by the accused did not cause them any prejudice.In this case,  Chief\u00a0Justice\u00a0Wagner concluded, first, that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba had  proved that an error reviewable on appeal had been made and, second, that the  Crown had failed to establish that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba\u2019s fundamental right had  not in fact been violated despite the judge\u2019s breach of his informational duty  under section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.  For these reasons, Chief\u00a0Justice\u00a0Wagner allowed the appeal, quashed Mr.\u00a0Tayo  Tompouba\u2019s conviction and ordered that a new trial be held in French.",

The alleged offences include conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline, disobeying lawful commands of a superior officer, behaving with contempt towards a superior officer, drug trafficking, sexual assault, disgraceful conduct, and drunkenness. These service offences are governed by the Code of Service Discipline (CSD) in Part III of the National Defence Act (NDA). The motions brought by the accused involve allegations that the statutory requirement that the military judges presiding over their courts martial be officers, as per sections 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA, violates their right to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal under section 11(d) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe trial process began with the military judges hearing the cases of the appellants, who were charged with service offences. Some of the military judges held that they lacked judicial independence due to their dual status as judges and officers, and therefore, the appellants' section 11(d) rights were infringed. The court martial judges entered stays of proceedings for some of the appellants as a remedy for this Charter breach. The Crown appealed the stays of proceedings to the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada (CMAC), which allowed the appeals, set aside the stays, and directed the matters to proceed to trial. The CMAC held that the safeguards in the National Defence Act adequately protect judicial independence and impartiality in light of the purposes of military justice in Canada. The appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeals, with Justice Karakatsanis dissenting.\n\nThe Court's decision is guided by the principle that a reasonable and informed person must consider the institutional independence of a tribunal, taking into account the relevant context and circumstances. The Court has identified three essential conditions of judicial independence: security of tenure, financial security, and administrative independence.\n\nWriting for the majority, Kasirer J. held that the requirement that military judges be officers under the National Defence Act does not violate the guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality under section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The majority found that the dual status of military judges as both judges and officers does not offend section 11(d), as the NDA provides sufficient safeguards to ensure judicial independence, including security of tenure, financial security, and administrative independence. The majority also rejected the appellants' argument that the military status of military judges creates a conflict of interest and undermines their impartiality, finding that military judges can lay aside their duties and allegiances as officers when exercising their judicial duties. This decision upholds the constitutionality of sections 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA and provides clarity on the compatibility of military judges' dual status with the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court holds  that the military status of military judges does not violate the constitutional  guarantee of judicial independence to which persons tried before courts martial  are entitled. </strong>These appeals are about whether the requirement under  the <em>National Defence Act</em> that military  judges be military officers violates the right to a hearing by an independent  and impartial tribunal guaranteed under Section 11(d) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  \u00a0The appeals were brought by nine members of the  Canadian Armed Forces who were accused of various service offences under the  Code of Service Discipline, which forms part of the <em>National Defence Act</em>. Service offences, which include offences  specific to military personnel and offences under the <em>Criminal Code </em>and other Canadian laws, are tried before a court  martial, a military court that has the same powers, rights, and privileges as a  superior court of criminal jurisdiction. Courts martial are presided over by  military judges, who are required by the <em>National  Defence Act </em>to have been lawyers and military officers for at least 10  years. As officers, military judges are part of the chain of command. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the courts martial, most of the nine accused members  challenged the requirement under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>that the military judges presiding over their courts martial be  officers. They argued that this requirement violates their right to a hearing  by an independent and impartial tribunal under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. The divided loyalties of  military judges as judge and officer were said to deflect them from a proper  exercise of their judicial duties and leaves them vulnerable to pressures from  the chain of command.Under Canadian law, courts must evaluate independence  and impartiality under Section 11(d) by asking whether an informed and  reasonable person would perceive the tribunal at issue as independent. In the  courts martial, some of the military judges held that they lacked judicial  independence because of their dual status of judge and officer, and that for  this reason, the accused members\u2019 Section 11(d) rights were infringed. The  Court Martial Appeal Court disagreed, and said that an informed person, viewing  the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through,  would conclude that military judges are sufficiently impartial and independent  to meet the requirement under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter. </em>Therefore, the accused members\u2019 rights were not infringed.  The accused members appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. <strong>The status of  military judges as officers under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>is not incompatible with their judicial functions for the  purpose of Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Kasirer affirmed  that accused members of the Canadian Armed Forces who appear before military  judges are entitled to the same guarantee of judicial independence and  impartiality under Section 11(d) as accused persons who appear before civilian  criminal courts, but this does not require that the two systems be identical in  every respect. He held that as presently configured in the <em>National Defence Act</em>, Canada\u2019s system of military justice fully  ensures judicial independence for military judges in a way that takes account  of the military context, and specifically of the legislative policies of  maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the forces and public trust in  a disciplined armed forces. Justice Kasirer concluded that properly understood,  the military context does not diminish judicial independence. ",

Canada.\n\nThis appeal raises the central question of whether a claim for breach of treaty rights is actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\nThe Blood Tribe, a member of the Blackfoot Confederacy, entered into Treaty No. 7 with the Crown in 1877. The treaty established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148, with a size to be determined by a formula based on the number of families within the tribe. The Blood Tribe claimed that the actual size of the reserve was smaller than what was promised under the treaty. The core allegations involved breaches by the Crown under sections 91(24) and 35(1) of the Constitution Act, particularly regarding fiduciary duty arising from its failure to fulfill Treaty No. 7's TLE provisions according to its prescribed formula.\n\nThe trial judge found that Canada had breached its treaty commitments but dismissed all claims except for one related to treaty land entitlement (TLE). The Federal Court of Appeal allowed Canada's appeal and held that the TLE claim was statute-barred because treaties were not international agreements requiring incorporation into domestic law to be enforceable. The Blood Tribe appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that breach of treaty claims were not actionable prior to 1982 when section 35(1) came into force as part of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\nTreaty rights are enforceable from their execution and give rise to actionable duties under common law; therefore, limitations legislation applies to claims for breach of treaty rights.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice OBonsawin concluded that the Blood Tribe's claim for breach of treaty rights was actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Court held that treaty rights flow from the treaty itself, not from the Constitution, and are enforceable upon execution. As a result, the Blood Tribe's claim was statute-barred under Alberta's Limitation of Actions Act. However, Justice OBonsawin found that declaratory relief is warranted in this case due to the longevity and magnitude of Canada's dishonourable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. The majority opinion emphasized that treaties are binding legal instruments that must be upheld and create enforceable obligations based on mutual consent. The coming into force of section 35(1) did not create new treaty rights but rather accorded constitutional status to existing Aboriginal and treaty rights. This provision prevented Parliament from extinguishing these rights but did not alter their existence or scope.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an Indigenous tribe\u2019s treaty  land entitlement claim is statute-barred, but that declaratory relief is  warranted given the longevity and magnitude of the Crown\u2019s dishonorable  conduct.</strong>This appeal is about whether the breach of an Indigenous tribe\u2019s  treaty land entitlement was actionable in Canadian courts before the coming  into force of section 35(1) of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1982</em>, which recognized and affirmed the existing Aboriginal and treaty  rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.<strong></strong>The Blood Tribe are a member tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy of  First Nations. In 1877, Treaty No. 7 was made between the Crown and the  Confederacy. Treaty No. 7 established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148, the largest  reserve in Canada and the home of the Blood Tribe. The reserve\u2019s size was to be  set by the treaty land entitlement (\u201cTLE\u201d) provisions, based on a formula  promising one square mile for each family of five persons, or in that  proportion for larger and smaller families.The Blood Tribe has long claimed  that the size of the reserve did not respect the TLE formula. In 1971, a Blackfoot  researcher gathered information on the total number of people in the Blood  Tribe for the years 1879 to 1884 and, based on this information, confirmed that  the existing reserve boundaries did not match the boundaries owed under the TLE  formula. The Blood Tribe formally sought to negotiate with the Minister of  Indian Affairs, who rejected its claims. In 1980, the Chief at the time, Jim Shot Both Sides, commenced an  action together with others on behalf of the Blood Tribe in the Federal Court.  They alleged breaches of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment,  and negligence, and sought declaratory relief and damages for breach of  contract arising from the Crown\u2019s failure to fulfil the TLE according to the  prescribed formula (the \u201cTLE Claim\u201d). Declaratory relief is a determination of  a party\u2019s rights without other consequences.The trial judge dismissed all  claims except the TLE Claim, concluding that the Crown had miscalculated the  size of the reserve by underestimating the Blood Tribe\u2019s membership, and stated  that the Crown\u2019s conduct during the reserve\u2019s creation was unconscionable. The  trial judge found that although the facts underlying the TLE Claim were  discoverable in 1971 or shortly thereafter, the applicable six-year limitation  period did not begin to run until 1982, when the enactment of section 35(1) of  the Constitution Act, 1982 created a new cause of action for treaty breaches. The  remedies sought for the TLE Claim were therefore not statute-barred because the  action was commenced in 1980. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal and held that  the TLE Claim was statute-barred. In its view, section 35(1) did not create new  treaty rights, and a remedy was available for the TLE Claim prior to 1982  regardless of the framed cause of action. The Blood Tribe appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part and issued declaratory  relief.<strong>Section 35(1) of the  Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach of treaty  rights.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin explained that section  35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach  of treaty rights. Treaty rights flow from the treaty, not the Constitution, and  treaties are enforceable upon execution and give rise to actionable duties  under the common law. Accordingly, the Blood Tribe\u2019s TLE Claim was enforceable  at common law and actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1).  The Blood Tribe did not contest the trial judge\u2019s finding that the TLE Claim  was discoverable as early as 1971 or that the action was not commenced until  1980. As such, the TLE Claim is statute-barred by operation of the applicable  six-year limitation period.However, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin concluded that declaratory  relief is warranted in this case given the longevity and magnitude of the  Crown\u2019s dishonorable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. She wrote, \u201c[it] will  serve an important role in clarifying the Blood Tribe\u2019s TLE, identifying the  Crown\u2019s dishonourable conduct, assisting future reconciliation efforts, and  helping to restore the honour of the Crown.\u201d",

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Dismisses Eurobank's Appeal, Upholding the Application of the Fraud Exception to a Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n\nThis appeal centers around the interpretation of a letter of counter-guarantee in an international commercial transaction and involves the application of the fraud exception to the autonomy of demand guarantees.\n\nIn 1998, Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier) and the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense (HMOD) entered into a procurement contract for the purchase of 10 CL-415 firefighting amphibious aircraft. As part of the contract, Bombardier agreed to subcontract part of the manufacturing work to Greek suppliers. The subcontracting obligations were secured by a demand guarantee issued by Eurobank Ergasias S.A. (Eurobank) in favor of HMOD, governed by Greek law. A counter-guarantee was issued by the National Bank of Canada, governed by Quebec law, to secure the payment obligations of Eurobank under the demand guarantee. Disputes arose under the contract, and HMOD demanded payment under the demand guarantee, which Eurobank purportedly honored despite knowing of HMOD's allegedly fraudulent conduct.\n\nThe trial court found that HMOD engaged in fraudulent conduct by demanding payment under the letter of credit despite its undertaking not to do so while arbitration proceedings were ongoing. Eurobank was found to have participated in HMOD's fraud by paying HMOD under the letter of credit. The court ruled that the National Bank should be enjoined from paying under the counter-guarantee. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld most of the trial court's decision, except for the part that ordered HMOD to comply with the arbitral award, as it was not within the court's jurisdiction. Eurobank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the Greek courts had found that HMOD did not engage in fraudulent conduct and that Eurobank did not have knowledge of any fraud.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal, ruling that the Greek courts' decisions were not relevant to the application of the fraud exception under Canadian law governing the counter-guarantee. The court held that Eurobank participated in HMOD's fraudulent conduct and that the National Bank should be enjoined from paying under the counter-guarantee.\n\nThe Supreme Court established that the fraud exception to the autonomy of demand guarantees is a narrow exception that requires clear or obvious knowledge of fraud by the guarantor. A beneficiary's demand for payment under a demand guarantee will only be considered fraudulent if it is apparent that there was no right to payment.\n\nWriting for the majority, Kasirer J. concluded that the fraud exception applies to Eurobank's demand for payment under the letter of counter-guarantee. The Court held that, given that Eurobank knew of and participated in fraud by HMOD, that fraud can be attributed to Eurobank as its own. This conclusion is based on the finding that HMOD engaged in a fraudulent attempt to circumvent the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal by demanding payment, despite knowing it had no right to do so. Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, knew of HMOD's fraudulent conduct and participated in it by demanding payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Therefore, the National Bank was rightly enjoined from paying out any amount under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court confirms that a Canadian bank must refuse payment to the beneficiary of a  letter of credit due to fraud. </strong>In this appeal, the Court addressed  the issue of whether a Canadian bank was required to refuse payment to the  beneficiary of a letter of credit because of a third party\u2019s fraudulent  behaviour, which was attributable to the beneficiary. In 1998, Bombardier Inc., a  Canadian aviation company based in Montreal, concluded a procurement contract  with the Hellenic Ministry of Defence (HMOD) in Greece for the sale of 10  firefighting airplanes. They also concluded a second contract pursuant to which  Bombardier agreed to subcontract some of the work associated with the airplane procurement  to Greek companies. That contract said that if, at the end of a 10-year term,  Bombardier did not fulfil its subcontracting obligation, it would owe HMOD a  certain amount of money relative to the main contract. To secure payment of the money  Bombardier might owe HMOD under the second contract, the Greek bank at the time  (now Eurobank Ergasias S.A., or, Eurobank) issued a letter of credit guaranteeing  that Eurobank would pay if Bombardier did not (the Letter of Guarantee). For  its part, Eurobank obtained a letter of credit from the National Bank of Canada  to secure a reimbursement in the amount that it would need to pay HMOD under  the Letter of Guarantee if the latter claimed that Bombardier failed to perform  its obligations under the second contract (the Letter of Counter-Guarantee). In  short, the letters would work as follows: if HMOD asked Eurobank to honour the  Letter of Guarantee, Eurobank would then be entitled to turn to the National  Bank to reimburse it under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.A dispute eventually arose  between HMOD and Bombardier with respect to the latter\u2019s subcontracting  obligations. HMOD demanded payment from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee.  In response, Bombardier asked the Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec for an order to stop  the National Bank from honouring a subsequent demand for repayment by Eurobank  under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier alleged that HMOD, a third  party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, committed fraud by demanding payment  before the dispute was resolved by the planned arbitration procedure and that,  because of Eurobank\u2019s knowledge and participation in the fraud, the National  Bank should be prevented from needing to repay Eurobank on the basis of the  \u201cfraud exception\u201d. Under Canadian law, banks have a nearly absolute obligation to  pay the beneficiary of a letter of credit when a valid  demand is made, except when the  beneficiary has committed fraud and it is brought to the bank\u2019s attention  before payment. In this case, Bombardier argued that given HMOD\u2019s fraudulent  conduct, Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was,  by extension, also fraudulent. The Superior Court rejected  Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee on the  basis of the fraud exception. It held that the manner in which HMOD obtained  payment under the Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent, and that Eurobank\u2019s own  conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of  which it was aware. It therefore concluded the National Bank was not required  to repay Eurobank. A majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal agreed and  dismissed the appeal. Eurobank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. \u00a0<strong>The fraud exception applies with respect to Eurobank\u2019s demand for  payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Kasirer explained that because Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud committed by HMOD, that  fraud could be attributed to it as though it was its own. The requirement that  there be fraud by the beneficiary to apply the fraud exception was therefore  met. Moreover, there was no question that Eurobank\u2019s fraud was brought to the  attention of the National Bank as the insurer of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee. On that basis, Justice Kasirer concluded that the National  Bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under  the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank and the majority of the Court of  Appeal made no mistake in that conclusion.",
