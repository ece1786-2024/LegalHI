The court decided that the trial judge erred in characterizing evidence of the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant as \"past discreditable conduct,\" which is a type of evidence generally inadmissible in criminal proceedings.\n\n**Central legal question**\n\nThe central legal question in this case is whether the trial judge erred in law by characterizing evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant as \"past discreditable conduct\" and whether this error had a material bearing on the acquittal.\n\n**Background of the case**\n\nThe accused, T.J.F., was in a common-law relationship with J.D., the complainant, from 2004 to 2012. The relationship was marked by violence, evictions, and financial difficulties. The complainant alleged that the accused forced her into prostitution and controlled the proceeds. The accused was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it. The trial judge acquitted the accused, finding the complainant's evidence lacking in credibility and holding that the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence did not directly address or support the charges. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals.\n\n**Court proceedings**\n\nThe accused was tried at the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, where the Crown presented evidence, including the testimony of the complainant and five other witnesses, as well as six exhibits. The accused elected not to testify. After a six-day trial, the trial judge acquitted the accused on both charges. The Crown appealed the acquittals to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal.\n\n**Legal principle established**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada held that the trial judge erred in law by characterizing evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant as \"past discreditable conduct.\" The court established that this type of evidence can be relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in persons offense and the definition of exploitation.\n\n**Court's reasoning**\n\nIn the majority reasons, Justice O'Bonsawin found that the trial judge's mischaracterization of the evidence tainted his analysis of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary foundation relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in persons offense and the definition of exploitation. The court held that the error of law might have had a material bearing on the acquittals and that the trial judge's assessment of the complainant's credibility might have been different if the evidence of the other witnesses was considered as part of the actus reus rather than past discreditable conduct.\n\nIn dissenting reasons, Justices Cote and Rowe found that the trial judge's error in characterizing the evidence as past discreditable conduct did not have a material bearing on the acquittal. They argued that the trial judge's credibility findings, which were based on a thorough assessment of the evidence, should be afforded deference on appeal.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets  aside a man\u2019s acquittals for trafficking in persons and orders a new trial.</strong>This appeal addresses whether  evidence of past violence may be relevant to the offence of trafficking in persons  in a criminal prosecution.From 2004 to 2012, the complainant  and the accused were in a common law relationship that was plagued by violence  and financial difficulties. According to the complainant, the accused persuaded  her to have sex on a webcam for money, dance for men, and offer sexual services  for money, which she did because of the accused\u2019s violence and threats towards  her. She also claimed that the accused was deeply involved in the sexual services, including posting ads offering sexual  services, and received all the money. She  stated that this continued  until she left the accused in 2012. The accused was charged with trafficking in  persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections  279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. At trial, the  complainant and five other witnesses provided evidence of the accused\u2019s  violence towards the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the accused. He  accepted that the complainant was in a violent relationship with the accused, but  he found her testimony lacking in credibility. He also had a reasonable doubt  about the accused\u2019s ties to any prostitution enterprise. He considered the evidence  from the other witnesses as backdrop, but not in relation to the alleged  offences, concluding that it related to \u201cpast discreditable conduct\u201d. Evidence  of past discreditable conduct relates to past misconduct of the accused that  goes beyond what is alleged by the prosecution in relation to an offence and is  not normally admissible. The Crown appealed the  acquittals to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge should have  considered the evidence of the other witnesses about the accused\u2019s violence  towards the complainant. The majority of the Court of Appeal confirmed the  acquittals. It held that the trial judge was wrong to conclude that the accused\u2019s violence was past discreditable conduct but that  the error did not have a significant impact on the  acquittals. The majority also concluded that the trial judge did not fail  to consider all the evidence. The dissenting judge would have ordered a new  trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence, and  that treating the accused\u2019s violence as past discreditable conduct  misapprehended its nature and relevance to the elementsof both offences that the Crown needed to establish. The Crown  appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has  allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial.<strong>Evidence of regular violence, threats of violence, and a  violent relationship may be relevant to the elements of the offence of  trafficking in persons.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin concluded that the trial judge assessed the  evidence based on a wrong legal principle by determining that the evidence of  violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was  evidence of past discreditable conduct. This error of law hindered his  assessment of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary  foundation relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in  persons offence and the definition of exploitation set  out in section 279.04 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. The trial  judge\u2019s error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals. They should  therefore be set aside and a new trial ordered.",

In 2016, TransAlta entered into an off-coal agreement with Alberta, agreeing to cease coal-fired emissions by December 31, 2030 in exchange for substantial transition payments from Alberta. The Minister established guidelines for assessing linear property under the Municipal Government Act (MGA), which included provisions that deprived TransAlta and other parties to off-coal agreements from claiming additional depreciation on their facilities.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nTransAlta challenged the vires (authority) of these guidelines on two grounds: that they discriminated against it without statutory authorization and that they were inconsistent with the purposes of the MGA. The chambers judge upheld their validity, as did a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel at Court of Appeal.\n\n**Legal Principle Established**\nThis case establishes that when reviewing subordinate legislation like these guidelines, courts should apply a reasonableness standard unless there is an exception or rule-of-law issue requiring correctness review. This principle was set out in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov but applied here specifically to subordinate legislation.\n\n**Court's Reasoning**\nThe court found that while these guidelines do discriminate against parties who have entered into off-coal agreements like TransAlta by depriving them from claiming additional depreciation on those facilities' reduced lifespan due to such agreements - this discrimination is statutorily authorized because it falls within a reasonable interpretation that ensures assessments are current, correct, fair and equitable according to MGA's purpose; also since transition payments account for some loss value arising out early retirement thus preventing double dipping if allowed further deprecation claims under Linear Guidelines",

Auer</a></em>, which was released on the same day, are both about the  standard of review that applies when subordinate legislation is challenged on  judicial review before a court. Subordinate legislation sets out legally  binding rules that are not made by a legislature, such as the Legislative  Assembly of Alberta, but instead by another entity given authority to make them  by that legislature.<strong> </strong>The standard of  review is the approach a court takes to analyzing a decision, like a decision  to make subordinate legislation.TransAlta  Generation Partnership owns coal-fired electric power generation  facilities in Alberta. In 2016, TransAlta entered into an agreement with  Alberta. It agreed to cease  coal-fired emissions on or before December 31, 2030, in exchange for  substantial transition payments from Alberta for 14 years to compensate for losses  resulting from the reduced life of its coal-fired facilities. TransAlta\u2019s  coal-fired facilities are assessed as \u201clinear property\u201d for municipal tax  purposes. Alberta\u2019s <em>Municipal Government Act </em>authorizes the Minister of  Municipal Affairs to establish guidelines for assessing the value of linear  property. In 2017, the Minister  established the <em>2017 Alberta Linear  Property Assessment Minister\u2019s Guidelines </em>under the Act. The  Guidelines, which are subordinate  legislation, deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim a more favourable tax position because  of the reduction in its facilities\u2019 lifespan resulting from the off-coal agreement. TransAlta said the Minister had gone beyond his authority in making the Guidelines  (that they were <em>ultra vires</em>) because they  are discriminatory and inconsistent with the purposes of the Act.The Court of King\u2019s  Bench said the Guidelines were valid and did not discriminate against TransAlta. The Court  of Appeal dismissed TransAlta\u2019s appeal.  The Court of Appeal held that the principles articulated in the Supreme Court  of Canada\u2019s decision in <em>Katz Group  Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care)</em> determined how the  Guidelines should be reviewed. That decision says that in order to find subordinate  legislation to be beyond the authority  granted by a statute because it is inconsistent with the purpose of that  statute, it had to be shown that it was  \u201cirrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated\u201d to the purpose. The Court of Appeal  held that the subsequent decision  in <em><a href=\"../2019/37748-eng.aspx\">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em> did not  change these principles. Following <em>Vavilov</em>,the presumptive standard of review is  reasonableness. A reasonable decision  is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It has to make sense in light of the  law and the facts, but need not be the only right answer. TransAlta appealed again to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed its appeal. <strong>The  guidelines fall reasonably within the scope of the Minister\u2019s authority under Alberta\u2019s <em>Municipal Government Act</em>.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained that the reasonableness standard under <em>Vavilov</em> presumptively applies when  reviewing whether subordinate legislation was authorized by law. Certain  principles from <em>Katz Group </em>continue  to inform reasonableness review, but for a court to  find subordinate legislation to be beyond  the authority granted in statute because  it is inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it no longer  needs to be \u201cirrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated\u201d to that purpose. The  governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law rules, and  the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant  constraints when determining whether subordinate  legislation falls reasonably within the scope of the authority.

The Governor in Council  (the Governor General acting on the advice of Cabinet) has authority under the <em>Divorce Act </em>to make guidelines dealing  with orders for such child support.

However, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased to 14 years after the dates of the alleged offences and before charges were laid. The respondents first appeared in the Court of Quebec in 2019 and reserved their right to elect their mode of trial. The amendment to s. 535 came into force in 2019, restricting the availability of preliminary inquiries to accused persons charged with offences punishable by 14 years or more imprisonment.\n\n**Court proceedings in one paragraph:** The Court of Quebec held that the new s. 535 applied to both respondents and that it lacked jurisdiction to preside over a preliminary inquiry. The respondents challenged this decision in the Superior Court, which dismissed their applications. The respondents then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed their appeals, holding that the new rule in s. 535 did not apply to them and that they had a vested right to preliminary inquiries. The Court of Appeal remitted the files to the Court of Quebec for preliminary inquiries.\n\n**Legal principle established in one sentence:** The right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time charges are laid, and an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry if their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment.\n\n**Court's reasoning in one paragraph:** The court held that the abolition of the preliminary inquiry for certain offences does not engage the principle of legality, but rather affects a substantive right, namely the accused's right to be discharged of any charge if, on the whole of the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry, no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial. The court found that the right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time charges are laid, as the accused's legal situation becomes tangible and concrete at that time. The court also held that the new s. 535 should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent expressed by Parliament to increase the sentences applicable to certain offences, and that the right to a preliminary inquiry is not affected by the accused's right to the benefit of the lesser punishment.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that new restrictions on the availability of preliminary inquiries do not apply  to certain ongoing criminal proceedings.</strong>This is an appeal about the interpretation of a new rule limiting  who is eligible to have a preliminary inquiry as part of their criminal  proceedings. A preliminary inquiry is a hearing before a court to determine  whether there is enough evidence against an accused person to proceed with a  trial.In unrelated cases, Ag\u00e9nor Archambault and  Gilles Grenier were charged with one or more historical sexual offences against  a child. After the dates of the alleged offences and before charges were laid in  2019, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased from 10 to 14  years\u2019 imprisonment. Since the law in place at the time  of the alleged crime governs the maximum sentence, the maximum that applies to  the cases of Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier is 10 years, not 14 years.In 2020, Mr.\u00a0Archambault and  Mr.\u00a0Grenier each requested a preliminary inquiry. However, under an  amendment to s.\u00a0535 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> that took effect on September 19, 2019, the availability of  preliminary inquiries was now restricted to accused persons charged with  offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment. In both cases,  the Crown argued that, under the amended version of s.\u00a0535, the court  could not hold a preliminary inquiry.The Court of Qu\u00e9bec held that the new  s.\u00a0535 applied to Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier and that it  lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry. Both of them  challenged that interpretation before the Superior Court but were unsuccessful.  They argued that they had the right to a preliminary inquiry because the new  rule in s. 535 did not apply to their proceedings. They also argued that even  under the new rule they were still entitled to a preliminary inquiry. They said  their offences should be considered punishable by 14 years or more for the  purposes of the new rule.The Court of Appeal  allowed their further appeals and sent the cases back to the Court of Qu\u00e9bec  for preliminary inquiries. The  Court of Appeal concluded that the amended version of s.\u00a0535 did not apply  to Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier. They had an entitlement to  preliminary inquiries before s.\u00a0535 was amended. The Court of Appeal  decided that the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry is based on the date of  the alleged offence. Given its conclusion, the Court of Appeal did not address  the question of how the amended version of s.\u00a0535 should be interpreted.The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier were not entitled to a preliminary inquiry. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.<strong>A  preliminary inquiry is available where the person is charged with an offence for  which they actually face a maximum sentence of at least 14 years</strong><strong> and in some other cases on  a transitional basis.</strong>A majority of the Court held that both Mr.  Archambault and Mr. Grenier were entitled to the preliminary inquiries they  requested. The old version of s. 535 continued to apply to them, rather than  the new rule. The fact that they had not requested a preliminary inquiry before  the change in the law was not determinative of their entitlement to preliminary  inquiries.A different majority of the  Court held that neither Mr. Archambault nor Mr. Grenier was eligible for a  preliminary inquiry under the new rule if it applied, as the offences were each  punishable by a maximum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. The new rule in s. 535  requires that the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years\u2019 imprisonment  in respect of the offence with which they are charged for a preliminary inquiry  to be available.",

    "baseline_summary": "**Summary Decision**\n\nThe court held that the driving prohibitions imposed on the appellant were unlawful, and the appeal should be allowed.\n\n**Central Legal Question**\n\nThe central legal question was whether s.320.24(4) of the Criminal Code permits the imposition of a driving prohibition upon conviction for the offence of criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm committed by means of a motor vehicle.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe appellant, Braydon Wolfe, was convicted of two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm after driving on the wrong side of a divided highway, causing a head-on collision that killed two people and seriously injured another. The trial judge imposed 10-year driving prohibitions for each criminal negligence causing death count and a 7-year prohibition for the criminal negligence causing bodily harm count.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe appellant appealed the driving prohibition orders to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal. The appellant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the sentencing judge had no authority to make the driving prohibition orders pursuant to s.320.24(4) of the Criminal Code.\n\n**Legal Principle Established**\n\nThe court established the principle that the term \"found guilty\" in s.320.24(4) of the Criminal Code requires an express judicial pronouncement on an offence stipulated in charging document or included in one that is, where the charged offence is not proved.\n\n**Court's Reasoning**\n\nThe court held that s.320.24(4) of the Criminal Code does not authorize the imposition of a driving prohibition order upon conviction for the offence of criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm committed by means of a motor vehicle. The court found that the term \"found guilty\" in s.320.24(4) requires an express judicial determination of guilt on an offence stipulated in the charging document or an included offence where the charged offence is not proved.\n\nThe court also considered the modern approach to statutory interpretation and found that the consequences of adopting a particular interpretation serve as an important interpretive aid within the modern approach to statutory interpretation.\n\nThe dissenting judges argued that the introduction of the term \"found guilty\" in s.320.24(4) is a clear change from the former s.259(2) and that the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal's interpretation of s.320.24(4) preserves the ability of sentencing judges to impose a driving prohibition on an offender convicted of driving-related criminal negligence. They also argued that the interpretation of s.320.24(4) that does not authorize driving prohibition orders as a penalty for criminal negligence produces an absurd consequence.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets  aside a driving prohibition order because that sentence was not available to  the sentencing judge under the Criminal Code.</strong>This appeal deals with the interpretation  of s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,  which allows a judge to impose a driving prohibition where a person has been  found guilty of one of the specified driving offences.Braydon Wolfe drove on the wrong  side of a divided highway and caused a head-on collision, killing two people  and seriously injuring another. He was found guilty of two counts of criminal  negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily  harm. In his reasons, the trial judge held that, if his analysis of the  criminal negligence counts was wrong, then he would convict the accused of two  counts of dangerous driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving  causing bodily injury. In addition to sentencing the accused to terms of  imprisonment, the trial judge issued a driving prohibition order imposing  concurrent 10-year driving prohibitions for each criminal negligence causing  death count and a concurrent 7-year prohibition for the criminal negligence  causing bodily harm count. Concurrent sentences are sentences for more than one  crime which are to be served at one time. Mr. Wolfe appealed against the length  of the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge. On appeal, the  court raised the question of whether the driving prohibitions could stand in  light of recent amendments to the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr.  Wolfe\u2019s sentence appeal. With respect to the availability of the driving  prohibition order, the court interpreted s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which permits sentencing  judges to impose a driving prohibition where an offender has been \u201cfound  guilty\u201d of one of the offences specified in that provision, as authorizing that  order, even though the offences are not specified offences. It held that the  criminal negligence convictions necessarily included a finding of guilt for the  lesser offence of dangerous driving, which is one of the offences specified in  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  Mr. Wolfe appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that recent  amendments to the <em>Criminal Code </em>did  not allow the sentencing judge to impose driving prohibition orders.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal and set aside the driving prohibition order imposed on Mr. Wolfe.<strong>Driving prohibitions could not be ordered because that sentence was not  available as an option to the sentencing judge.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin held that the driving prohibitions imposed on Mr. Wolfe  were unlawful. Mr. Wolfe was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and  criminal negligence causing bodily harm, which are not specified offences under  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. He  was not \u201cfound guilty\u201d of a specified offence within the meaning of that  provision. Accordingly, discretionary driving prohibitions were not available  as a sentencing option.\r\n     ",

    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that claims against a company operating a Ponzi scheme are not  statute-barred. </strong>Joseph  Lacasse owned and operated Golden Oaks Enterprises Inc, a rent-to-own residential  property company. Lorne Scott, one of the  appellants, was a real estate agent who was paid interest and commissions to  recruit new investors. The company  appeared to be successful, but, in reality, was a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme  is a form of fraud in which existing investors are paid with funds collected  from new investors. In this case, Mr. Lacasse lured investors to lend money to  the company for unlawfully high interest rates, and then paid existing  investors by recruiting new investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed in July 2013.  Doyle Salewski Inc. served as the \u201ctrustee in bankruptcy\u201d. A trustee  administers the property of a bankrupt person under the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act </em>(\u201c<em>BIA</em>\u201d).  Salewski started legal proceedings against the investors to recover the illegal  interest and commissions they were paid by Golden Oaks, arguing that they were  unjustly enriched. The investors argued in response that the actions were  statute-barred under Ontario\u2019s <em>Limitations  Act, 2002</em>, because Mr. Lacasse knew of the illegal payments when they were  made. The <em>Limitations Act, 2002 </em>says  that legal proceedings generally cannot be started more than two years after  the person making the claim knew or ought to have known of the claims. After  that point, they become \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.The  trial judge attributed Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge to the company. However, she found  that the trustee\u2019s actions against the company were not statute-barred for  other reasons. She ordered the investors to return the illegal interest  payments they had received. The investors appealed the trial judge\u2019s decision,  arguing that she had wrongly concluded that the actions were not statute-barred.  The trustee also appealed the trial judge\u2019s decision that Mr. Lacasse\u2019s  knowledge should be attributed to Golden Oaks. The  Court of Appeal did not accept the investors\u2019 arguments, and agreed with the  trustee that the trial judge should not have attributed Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge  to the company. The Court of Appeal concluded that there are public interest reasons  to ensure that those who benefitted from the Ponzi scheme could not avoid being  held responsible in legal proceedings by attributing Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge to  the company. The legal proceedings were therefore not statute-barred because Golden  Oaks did not have the knowledge to bring the actions at the relevant time. The  investors appealed to the Supreme Court, primarily on the grounds that Mr.  Lacasse\u2019s knowledge must be attributed to Golden Oaks, because it is a  one-person corporation and the two are essentially the same. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The knowledge of the sole officer and  shareholder of Golden Oaks should not be attributed to the corporation.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice Jamal concluded that the trustee\u2019s actions are not  statute-barred by the <em>Limitations Act,  2002</em>. The principles of the corporate attribution doctrine, summarized in  the companion appeal <em>Aquino v. Ernest  &amp; Young Inc.</em>, 2024 SCC 31, apply to one-person corporations. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. The Court of Appeal was therefore correct to  conclude that Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge should not be attributed to the company.  This would not have promoted the purposes of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> or the <em>BIA</em>,  which include avoiding the injustice of barring a claim before a person is able  to make it, and ensuring a fair distribution of the bankrupt person\u2019s assets  and protecting the public interest.

    "baseline_summary": "**Summary**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal, upholding the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, which had affirmed the application judge's ruling that the appellants were liable for transfers at undervalue under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA).\n\n**Court's Decision**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada held that the application judge did not misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent, and that the appellants' argument that the debtor companies could not have intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor because they were not insolvent at the time of the transfers was not supported by the evidence.\n\n**Central Legal Question**\n\nThe central legal question in this case was whether the intent of the directing mind of a corporation to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor can be attributed to the corporate debtor under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe case involved two family-owned construction companies, Bondfield Construction Company Limited and 1033803 Ontario Inc., which were experiencing financial difficulties. The companies' president and directing mind, John Aquino, and several other individuals had engaged in a false invoicing scheme, fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from the companies. The monitor and trustee in bankruptcy applied to the court to recover the monies on the basis that the transactions were transfers at undervalue under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe application judge held that the false invoice payments were transfers at undervalue and could be recovered by the monitor and trustee in bankruptcy under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA. The Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed the application judge's ruling, and the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\n**Legal Principle Established**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada established that the corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of its directing mind.\n\n**Court's Reasoning**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada held that the fraud and no benefit exceptions to corporate attribution do not apply in the context of a transfer at undervalue under section 96 of the BIA, as they would undermine the purpose of this statutory provision. The court found that the purpose of section 96 is to protect creditors from harmful actions by a debtor that would diminish the assets available for recovery, and that attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the corporation's directing mind to the corporation would serve this purpose.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that the fraudulent intent of the president of two construction  companies can be attributed to the companies in bankruptcy proceedings.</strong>This  appeal addressed when a court can attribute the intent of a senior officer or  employee, known as a \u201cdirecting mind\u201d, to the corporation. John  Aquino was the president of two family-owned construction companies that worked  on large-sale construction projects. When the companies began experiencing  serious financial difficulties, investigations revealed that Mr. Aquino and  several others had been fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from  the companies through a false invoicing scheme. For years, they created fake  invoices from fake suppliers for services that were never provided, and then  directed the construction companies to pay the invoices. In bankruptcy  proceedings against the companies, these payments were challenged under s.  96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>Bankruptcy and  Insolvency Act</em> (\u201c<em>BIA</em>\u201d). This  provision allows for the recovery of money if a transaction is a \u201ctransfer at  undervalue\u201d and the debtor intended to \u201cdefraud, defeat or delay a creditor\u201d. A  transfer at undervalue is a transaction where property or services are provided  to another person for nothing in exchange or for much less than fair market  value. The  application judge concluded that the false invoice payments were transfers at  undervalue. She found that the payments involved several \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d,  which are suspicious circumstances that may help prove fraudulent intent. She  rejected the argument that the construction companies could not have had fraudulent  intent because they were paying their creditors in full and on time at the time  of the payments. She considered the purpose of bankruptcy legislation, which is  to provide a remedy to creditors, and concluded that Mr. Aquino\u2019s intent should  be attributed to the companies. She ordered Mr. Aquino and others to pay the  money they received under the scheme. Mr. Aquino and the others involved in the  scheme appealed the application judge\u2019s ruling. Both before the Court of Appeal  and the Supreme Court, they repeated the arguments made before the application  judge. The Court of Appeal upheld the application judge\u2019s ruling. <strong>The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.</strong>Writing  for the Court, Justice Jamal concluded that the application judge did not  misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent. A court  may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under  s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>BIA </em>even if  the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfer at undervalue. There  is therefore no basis to interfere with the application judge\u2019s conclusion that  Mr. Aquino intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor under the false  invoicing scheme. Furthermore, Mr. Aquino\u2019s fraudulent intent should be  attributed to the debtor companies because he was their directing mind and  acted in the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to him. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. In the context of a claim under s. 96 of the <em>BIA</em>, the \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cno benefit\u201d exceptions  to corporate attribution should not apply because these exceptions would  undermine the purpose of this provision. The test for corporate attribution  under s. 96 is simply whether the person was the directing mind and whether  their actions were performed within the sector or corporate responsibility  assigned to them.",

The Agency subsequently adopted the Regulations, which came into force in 2019. The Regulations include provisions dealing with standardized amounts of compensation for international flight delays, cancellations, and denial of boarding, as well as refunds of baggage fees paid by passengers when the carrier has lost or damaged their baggage on international flights.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe International Air Transport Association, the Air Transportation Association of America, and several air carriers serving Canadian and international airports challenged the Regulations in a statutory appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. The airlines alleged that the Regulations conflict with the exclusivity principle of the Montreal Convention and are ultra vires the Agency's regulation-making authority under the CTA. The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the challenge, with the exception of the provisions relating to the temporary loss of baggage.\n\n**Legal Principle Established**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada established that the Montreal Convention's exclusivity principle applies only to actions for damages that share the characteristics of judicial proceedings in courts of law and seek individualized compensation for death or bodily injury, damage or loss of baggage and cargo, and for delay in international carriage.\n\n**Court's Reasoning**\n\nThe Court held that the Regulations do not provide for an action for damages because they do not provide for individualized compensation. Instead, the Regulations create a consumer protection scheme that operates in parallel with the Montreal Convention, without trenching on its liability limitation provisions. The Court also held that the Regulations do not conflict with the Montreal Convention as implemented by the Carriage by Air Act and therefore are not ultra vires the CTA.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that airlines can be required to compensate passengers for certain  international flight disruptions.</strong>This is an appeal about whether a federal agency  can require airlines to pay compensation to passengers for certain  international flight disruptions. It addresses whether that compensation is  consistent with a treaty dealing with some aspects of international air travel. In 2018, Parliament amended the <em>Canada Transportation Act</em> (\u201cCTA\u201d) to  require that the Canadian Transportation Agency make regulations establishing  what it described as a \u201cnew air passenger rights regime\u201d. In 2019, the Agency  made the <em>Air Passenger Protection  Regulations</em>. The Regulations say what airlines have to do for passengers in  the case of international flight delays, cancellations and denial of boarding,  which in some cases includes paying a set minimum amount of compensation. They  also require airlines to refund baggage fees paid by passengers when an airline  has lost or damaged their baggage on international flights.The International Air Transport Association, the  Air Transportation Association of America, and several airlines (collectively,  \u201cairlines\u201d) challenged certain provisions of the Regulations before the Federal  Court of Appeal. The airlines said that the provisions were not consistent with  the <em>Convention for the Unification of  Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air</em> (\u201cMontreal Convention\u201d) and  fell outside the Agency\u2019s regulation-making authority under the CTA. The Montreal Convention is an international  agreement that Canada signed in 2001 and that has been implemented into  Canadian law. It sets out certain conditions and limits on what airlines can be  required to pay passengers to compensate for international flight disruptions. Article  29 of the Montreal Convention says that any \u201caction for damages\u201d within the  scope of the agreement is subject to those conditions and limits. This is  called the \u201cexclusivity principle\u201d, because it prevents a person from bringing  an \u201caction for damages\u201d not subject to the conditions and limits even if there  is another basis in law to do so.The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the  challenge brought by the airlines, with the exception of the provisions  relating to the temporary loss of baggage. It considered the compatibility of  the Regulations with the Montreal Convention, and concluded that the  compensation provided for under the Regulations is not an \u201caction for damages\u201d.The Airlines appealed to the Supreme Court  seeking an order setting aside certain provisions of the Regulations as they  relate to international air travel. The Supreme Court has dismissed the Airlines\u2019  appeal.<strong>The  compensation payable to passengers is not individualized and is not therefore an  \u201caction for damages\u201d limited by the Montreal Convention.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Rowe explained  that the Montreal Convention is exclusive within the scope of the matters that  it addresses but does not deal comprehensively with all aspects of  international carriage by air. Under Article 29, there must be an \u201caction\u201d that  leads to \u201cdamages\u201d for the exclusivity principle to apply. However, the  Regulations do not provide for an \u201caction for damages\u201d because they do not  provide for individualized compensation. Rather, they create a consumer  protection scheme that operates in parallel with the Montreal Convention, without  trenching on its liability limitation provisions. Thus, they do not fall within  the scope of the Montreal Convention\u2019s exclusivity principle. Since the  Regulations do not give rise to liability that is pre-empted by Article 29,  they do not conflict with the Montreal Convention and there is no basis to  conclude that they are outside the jurisdiction of the Agency.",

A majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld this decision on appeal.\n\n**Legal Principle Established:** Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible; however, it can be exceptionally admitted into evidence when necessity and threshold reliability are met on a balance of probabilities.\n\n**Court Reasoning (Majority):**\n\nThe majority held that there was no connection between corroborative evidence (the discovery of pistols at K.A.'s residence) and K.A.'s degree of involvement in events; therefore, this corroborative evidence could not establish threshold reliability for that aspect of K.A.'s statement.\nK.A.'s statement presented significant dangers due to his interest in minimizing his role and exaggerating Charles' responsibility.\nThe absence of external evidence confirming Charles' primary role in events meant circumstantial guarantees could not overcome these dangers.\nThe indicia of reliability did not support admissibility as they did not rule out plausible alternative explanations for K.A.'s statements.\nConsidering complainant testimony outside voir dire would require invoking curative proviso s 686(1)(b)(iii), which was not done by Crown before Supreme Court.\n\n\n(Cote J., Rowe J., Kasirer J.)",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial because of the erroneous admission of an out\u2011of\u2011court  statement at trial.</strong>This appeal concerns  the admissibility in evidence of an out\u2011of\u2011court statement made by a trial witness.Following an incident  involving the accused and the complainant at the school they attended, the  accused was charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm and  uttering threats. At trial, the complainant testified that he had entered a  washroom at the school and had felt something on his hip while washing his  hands. When he turned around, he saw that it was a pistol held by the accused,  being used to threaten him. Two other students were present at the time. One of  them, who testified at the accused\u2019s trial, claimed to have no recollection of  the events. The prosecution therefore requested a <em>voir dire</em>, seeking the admission into evidence of an out\u2011of\u2011court  statement given by that witness to the police investigators the day after the  events. A <em>voir dire</em> is a proceeding  held in the absence of the jury during a criminal trial to allow the judge to consider,  for example, the admissibility of evidence that a party wishes to present. The witness had  been questioned by the police investigators for about an hour and had provided  a written statement. Among other things, the witness admitted in his statement  that he was in possession of two pellet pistols. The police conducted a search  and recovered the pistols at the witness\u2019s residence. The trial judge admitted  the witness\u2019s out\u2011of\u2011court statement into evidence. The judge found that the  only likely explanation for the statement was its truthfulness as to its  material aspects, given the circumstances in which the statement was made and  the seizure of pistols, which the judge considered to be corroborative  evidence. Corroborative evidence is evidence that reinforces other evidence. Following the trial, the  accused was found guilty of the three charges. The judge accepted the  complainant\u2019s version of events, which was supported by a surveillance video  and the witness\u2019s statement. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the trial  judge\u2019s decision to admit the statement into evidence and dismissed the  accused\u2019s appeal. The Supreme  Court of Canada has allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions. The Court  has also ordered a new trial. <strong>The out\u2011of\u2011court statement did not have the  indicia of reliability required to be admitted at trial.</strong>Writing for  the majority of the Court, Justice\u00a0Moreau\u00a0determined that the trial judge had erred  in finding that the witness\u2019s out\u2011of\u2011court statement had the required indicia  of reliability and in admitting the statement into evidence at trial. The  results of the search subsequently conducted at the witness\u2019s residence do not  meet the criteria for corroborative evidence laid down by the Supreme Court in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16702/index.do\">R.  v. Bradshaw</a></em>. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the statement do  not support a finding that threshold reliability is established. Finally, the  majority of the Court of Appeal should not have relied on the complainant\u2019s  testimony, given outside of the <em>voir dire</em>,  to hold that the threshold reliability of the witness\u2019s statement was  established.

    "baseline_summary": "**Summary:**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the disgorgement orders imposed by the British Columbia Securities Commission on the appellants, Thalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian, survive bankruptcy under section 178(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA). However, the administrative penalties imposed by the Commission do not survive bankruptcy under either section 178(1)(a) or section 178(1)(e).\n\n**Central Legal Question:**\n\nDo the administrative penalties and disgorgement orders imposed by the British Columbia Securities Commission on the appellants survive bankruptcy under sections 178(1)(a) and 178(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act?\n\n**Background:**\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, the Poonians engaged in market manipulation that caused vulnerable investors to lose millions of dollars. The British Columbia Securities Commission found that they had contravened the Securities Act and ordered them to pay administrative penalties of $13.5 million and to disgorge approximately $5.6 million, which represented the amounts they obtained as a result of the market manipulation scheme.\n\n**Court Proceedings:**\n\nThe Commission applied for a declaration that these amounts be non-releasable debts under section 178(1) of the BIA. The chambers judge allowed the application, finding that the debts were exempt under section 178(1)(a) and (e). The British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld the decision, but on the basis of section 178(1)(e) only.\n\n**Legal Principle Established:**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada established that for a debt or liability to survive bankruptcy under section 178(1)(e) of the BIA, there must be a direct causal link between the creation of the debt or liability and the debtor's deceit.\n\n**Court's Reasoning:**\n\nThe majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that the administrative penalties imposed by the Commission did not survive bankruptcy under either section 178(1)(a) or section 178(1)(e), as they were not imposed by a court and did not result directly from the Poonians' fraudulent misrepresentation. However, the disgorgement orders were found to survive bankruptcy under section 178(1)(e) as they represented the value of the Poonians' fraud and were directly linked to their fraudulent conduct.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court concludes that bankruptcy does not release people from orders to pay amounts obtained by fraud, but  could release them from administrative penalties.</strong>This appeal is  about whether bankruptcy releases  persons from having to comply with certain orders imposed on them by a regulatory  agency for having broken the law. Bankruptcy is a legal process through which a  person can be released, or discharged, from having to pay certain debts,  subject to conditions.Between 2007 and 2009, Thalbinder  Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian engaged in a scheme in which they manipulated  the share price of a public oil and gas company called OSE Corp. and then sold  the overpriced shares to investors. The scheme caused vulnerable investors to  lose millions of dollars. In 2014, the British Columbia  Securities Commission found that the Poonians had violated the province\u2019s <em>Securities Act</em>. It eventually ordered  them to pay $13.5 million in administrative penalties. Administrative penalties  are consequences for having broken the law that are imposed by administrative  tribunals or regulatory agencies instead of the courts. The Commission also  ordered the Poonians to pay a further $5.6 million, representing the amounts  they had obtained as a result of the scheme. These are called \u201cdisgorgement  orders\u201d. In 2018, the Poonians went into  bankruptcy. Section 178(1) of the federal <em>Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act</em> lists certain debts from which a person is not released  through bankruptcy (debts that are \u201cexempted from discharge\u201d). The Commission asked  the Supreme Court of British Columbia to decide whether the amounts owed to it  by the Poonians would be exempted from discharge, based on this rule. The Supreme Court of British  Columbia said that the orders would be exempted from discharge. It found that  the exceptions in s. 178(1)(a) \u2014 relating to penalties \u201cimposed by a court\u201d \u2014  and in s. 178(1)(e) \u2014 relating to debt that results from \u201cobtaining property or  services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation\u201d \u2014 both applied. The Poonians\u2019 appeal to the Court  of Appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal concluded that although the s.  178(1)(a) exception did not apply because the Commission\u2019s decisions were not  \u201cimposed by a court\u201d, the exception in s. 178(1)(e) did apply. The Poonians  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal in part. It has reversed the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the  administrative penalties are exempted from discharge under s. 178(1)(e), while  upholding its conclusion that the disgorgement orders are exempted.<strong>Orders to pay  amounts that were obtained by fraud are directly linked to that fraud in a way  that administrative penalties are not.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  C\u00f4t\u00e9 held that neither the administrative penalties nor the disgorgement orders  are exempted from discharge pursuant to s. 178(1)(a). The words \u201cimposed by a  court\u201d in s. 178(1)(a) do not capture orders made by administrative tribunals  or regulatory agencies, such as the Commission, that are subsequently  registered as judgments of a court. In addition, the administrative  penalties do not come within the exception in s. 178(1)(e), as they did not  result directly from the fraudulent scheme; rather, they arose indirectly as a  result of the Commission\u2019s decision to sanction the Poonians. The disgorgement  orders, however, are captured by the s. 178(1)(e) exception as there is a  direct link between them and the Poonians\u2019 fraudulent conduct. Therefore, they  will not be released by any possible future order of discharge.",

    "baseline_summary": "**The court's decision in one sentence**: The appeals are allowed in part, with the Supreme Court of Canada ruling that the Crown has a duty to consider increasing the annuities under the Robinson Treaties when economic conditions permit, and the amount paid to each individual can exceed $4 per person, subject to the Crown's discretion.\n\n**The central legal question in one sentence**: The central issue is the interpretation of the Augmentation Clause in the Robinson Treaties, which provides for an increase in the annual annuities paid to the Indigenous signatories if the Crown can do so without incurring loss.\n\n**Background of the case in one paragraph**: The Robinson Treaties, signed in 1850 between the Crown and Indigenous peoples, provided for the surrender of land in exchange for a perpetual annuity. The treaties included an Augmentation Clause, which allowed for an increase in the annuity if the Crown could do so without incurring loss. Despite the annuity being increased to $4 per person in 1875, it has remained at that amount ever since. The case was brought by the Huron and Superior plaintiffs seeking compensation for past breaches of the treaties, while the Crown argued that it had unfettered discretion to determine the annuity amount.\n\n**Court proceedings in one paragraph**: The case proceeded through multiple stages, including a trial, an appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, and a subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. At trial, the judge ruled that the Crown had a mandatory obligation to increase the annuities, but the Court of Appeal overturned this finding. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately heard the appeal and allowed it in part, ruling that the Crown's discretion is not unfettered and is subject to review by the courts.\n\n**The legal principle established in one sentence**: The honour of the Crown principle requires that the Crown acts fairly and justly in its dealings with Indigenous peoples and fulfills its treaty obligations with diligence and in a manner that maintains its honour.\n\n**The court's reasoning in one paragraph**: The Supreme Court of Canada based its decision on the principle of the honour of the Crown, which requires that the Crown act fairly and justly towards Indigenous peoples. The court held that the Augmentation Clause requires the Crown to consider increasing the annuity when economic conditions permit, and that the amount paid to each individual can exceed $4 per person. The court also ruled that the Crown's discretion is not unfettered and is subject to review by the courts, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to a remedy for the Crown's breach of the treaties.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court requires  the Crown to negotiate or, failing agreement, determine the compensation it  owes to First Nations for breaching its treaty promises.</strong>This judgment clarifies the rights  and obligations of the Crown and the Anishinaabe of Lake Huron and Lake  Superior under two historic treaties, and what the Crown must do to address its  breaches of those treaties. In 1850, the Anishinaabe of Lake  Huron and Lake Superior entered into treaties with the Crown, known as the  Robinson Treaties. Under the treaties, the Anishinaabe agreed to cede their  territories to the Crown and the Crown promised to provide in return an annuity  (a perpetual annual payment). The treaties provided for the increase of the  annuities over time under certain circumstances. This part of the treaty, known  as the \u201cAugmentation Clause\u201d, also provided that the amount \u201cpaid to each  individual\u201d each year would not exceed \u00a31 (equivalent to $4), but the Crown had the power to increase it to a higher amount chosen  in its discretion. The annuities  were increased to $4 to each individual in 1875, but have not increased since  then.The Anishinaabe of Lake Superior (\u201cSuperior  plaintiffs\u201d) filed a claim against the Crown in 2001 and the Anishinaabe of  Lake Huron filed their own claim in 2014 (\u201cHuron plaintiffs\u201d). Both plaintiffs alleged  the Crown had breached the Augmentation Clause and its fiduciary duty. Fiduciary  duty means that Canada is obliged to act in the best interest of Indigenous  Peoples. The plaintiffs asked the court to compensate them. The trial judge concluded that,  under the Augmentation Clause, the Crown must increase the annuities when the  economic circumstances warrant it, reflecting a \u201cfair share\u201d of the revenues  received by the Crown from the land. The trial judge said that the honour of  the Crown and a fiduciary duty required the Crown to diligently implement the  Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed from these decisions, arguing that  the trial judge was wrong in her interpretation of the Robinson Treaties. The Court of Appeal allowed Ontario\u2019s appeals in part. The Court of  Appeal agreed that the honour of the Crown applied to the case. A majority of the  Court of Appeal agreed that the Crown is required to increase the annuities  when the economic conditions warrant it, but did not agree that the treaties  promised a fair share of revenues. The Court of Appeal also agreed that the  Crown\u2019s power under the Augmentation Clause to decide whether to increase the  annuities is not unfettered. Unfettered means without any constraints. The  Court of Appeal also found that the Crown was not under a fiduciary duty in  relation to the Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada on a number of issues, including the proper interpretation of the  Augmentation Clause, the nature and content of the Crown\u2019s obligation to give  effect to that clause, and the appropriate remedy for its breach. The Huron and  Superior plaintiffs cross\u2011appealed on the question of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duties. Before the Court, neither  Canada nor Ontario disputed that they are in longstanding breach of the annuity  promises.The Supreme Court has allowed  Ontario\u2019s appeals in part, dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeals,  and issued a declaration about the rights and obligations under the  Augmentation Clause. <strong>An opportunity for negotiation and agreement outside the courtroom has  greater potential to renew the treaty relationship, advance reconciliation, and  restore the honour of the Crown.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Jamal held that  the interpretation of historic Crown-Indigenous treaties is reviewable for  correctness. This means that an appeal court can substitute its interpretation  for that of the lower court if deemed incorrect. Applying this standard of  review to this case, along with the relevant treaty interpretation principles,  Justice Jamal said that the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time,  whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. If the Crown can  increase the annuities beyond $4 to each individual, it must exercise its discretion  and decide whether to do so and, if so, by how much. This discretion is not  unfettered; it must be exercised liberally, justly, and in accordance with the  honour of the Crown. The frequency with which the Crown must consider whether  it can increase the annuities must also be consistent with the honour of the  Crown. Justice Jamal added that, given the longstanding and  egregious nature of the Crown\u2019s breach of the Augmentation Clause, the Crown  must exercise its discretion and increase the annuities with respect to the  past. Having already reached a negotiated settlement concerning past breaches  with the Huron plaintiffs, the Crown is directed to engage in time-bound and  honourable negotiation with the Superior plaintiffs about compensation for past  breaches. Finally, although no specific fiduciary duties apply in respect of  the augmentation promise, the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to  diligently fulfill this promise. ",

The court held that the state may be liable for Charter damages if the legislation is clearly unconstitutional or was enacted in bad faith or an abuse of power.\n\nThe central legal question in this case was whether damages can be an appropriate remedial response to the enactment of legislation subsequently declared unconstitutional.\n\nThe background of the case involved a claim by Joseph Power, a man who was convicted of two indictable offenses in 1996 and was permanently ineligible for a record suspension due to changes in the law. He sought damages under section 24(1) of the Charter for the breach of his rights caused by the enactment of the unconstitutional legislation.\n\nThe court proceedings involved Canada bringing a motion to the Court of Queen's Bench to determine whether the Crown, in its executive capacity, can be held liable in damages under section 24(1) for government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting legislation that is subsequently declared unconstitutional.\n\nThe legal principle established by the court is that the state is not entitled to absolute immunity from liability for damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes Charter rights. The court also clarified that the Mackin threshold for liability, which requires the state to act clearly wrong, in bad faith, or an abuse of power, should be restated as a \"good governance defence.\"\n\nThe court's reasoning was based on the principles of constitutionalism, the rule of law, and parliamentary sovereignty, as well as the importance of holding the state accountable for its actions. The court also considered the role of the Charter in protecting individual rights and the importance of providing effective remedies for breaches of those rights.\n\nIn summary, the court's decision allows for damages to be awarded against the state in certain circumstances for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation, providing a balance between the state's legislative autonomy and the need to hold the state accountable for its actions.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that the state can be required to pay damages for making unconstitutional  legislation in limited circumstances.</strong>This appeal is about whether the state is immune from liability for  damages when it makes legislation that courts later find to be unconstitutional.  Immunity from liability for damages means a situation in which courts cannot  require the payment of such damages.Joseph Power says he applied for  a record suspension in 2013 but his application was denied. A record suspension  allows people who were convicted of a criminal offence, but have completed  their sentence and demonstrated that they are law-abiding citizens, to have  their criminal record kept separate and apart from other criminal records in  some circumstances. Mr. Power says his criminal record prevented him from  working in the field in which he had trained.At the time of Mr. Power\u2019s conviction  in 1996, persons convicted of indictable offences could apply for a record suspension five years  after their release. An indictable offence is a category of more serious criminal  offences. Legislation enacted in 2010 and 2012 rendered Mr. Power permanently ineligible  for a record suspension. This legislation was declared unconstitutional by  courts in other proceedings and the Attorney General of Canada agrees that it violates the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  Mr. Power says he is owed damages under s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter </em>for the breach of his rights caused by the enactment of the  legislation.The Attorney General of Canada asked  the court hearing Mr. Power\u2019s claim to answer two questions. First, can the  state be required to pay damages for governments preparing and drafting a Bill  that later became law, and was subsequently declared unconstitutional? Second,  can the state be required to pay damages for Parliament enacting a Bill into  law, which was later declared unconstitutional?The Court  of Queen\u2019s Bench of New Brunswick answered  \u201cyes\u201d to both questions, finding that the state was entitled to only a limited  immunity from <em>Charter</em> damages for  unconstitutional legislation. The Court of Appeal of New  Brunswick agreed and dismissed the Attorney General of Canada\u2019s  appeal. The Attorney General appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has dismissed the  Attorney General\u2019s appeal.<strong> </strong><strong>The state may be required to pay damages for making  unconstitutional legislation if it is clearly unconstitutional, or was in bad  faith or an abuse of power.</strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice Wagner and Justice Karakatsanis held that the answer to both questions is  \u201cyes\u201d. The state is not entitled to an absolute immunity from liability for  damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes <em>Charter</em> rights. Rather, it may be liable  for <em>Charter </em>damages if the legislation is clearly unconstitutional or  was in bad faith or an abuse of power. An absolute immunity fails to properly  reconcile the constitutional principles that protect legislative autonomy, such  as parliamentary sovereignty and parliamentary privilege, and the principles  that require the government be held accountable for infringing <em>Charter</em> rights, such as  constitutionality and the rule of law. Each of these principles constitutes an  essential part of Canada\u2019s constitutional law and they must all be respected to  achieve an appropriate separation of powers. By shielding the government from  liability in even the most egregious circumstances, absolute immunity would  subvert the principles that demand government accountability. ",

    "baseline_summary": "**Summary**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal and restored the acquittal of Daniel Hodgson, who was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter after a trial by judge alone.\n\n**Central Legal Question**\nThe central legal question in this case is whether the Crown's right to appeal an acquittal under section 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code is limited to questions of law alone, and if so, whether the trial judge committed errors of law that would justify overturning an acquittal.\n\n**Background**\nDaniel Hodgson attended a house party where he was asked to assist with removing another guest, Bradley Winsor, who refused to leave despite repeated requests. A physical altercation ensued during which Hodgson used a chokehold to restrain Winsor, who lost consciousness and died. The trial judge found that Hodgson caused Winsor's death but acquitted him of second-degree murder due to lack of mens rea and manslaughter due to self-defense.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe Crown appealed the acquittal, arguing that the trial judge committed errors of law regarding mens rea for murder and self-defense. The Nunavut Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. Hodgson appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\n**Legal Principle Established**\nThe Supreme Court established that the Crown's right to appeal an acquittal under section 676(1)(a) is limited to questions of law alone, which means that appellate courts can only intervene if there is an error involving a question of law alone.\n\n**Court's Reasoning**\nThe court held that there was no error in law regarding mens rea for murder or self-defense. The court found that while it may be possible for chokeholds to be inherently dangerous acts in some cases, it is not an error in law for a trial judge not conclude as such based on evidence presented at trial. Additionally, while objective foreseeability may be relevant for manslaughter charges requiring objective mental fault (R v DeSousa), subjective intent must still be proven beyond reasonable doubt when assessing intent required for conviction on charge like Murder (R v Vaillancourt).",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores  a man\u2019s acquittal because the trial judge committed no errors of law which  would allow the Crown to appeal</strong>This appeal addresses the circumstances in which the Crown can  appeal an acquittal, the accused\u2019s state of mind (or <em>mens rea</em>) required for second degree murder, and the elements  required for self-defence. Mr. Hodgson attended a house party and was asked to help  with removing another guest who refused to leave despite repeated requests to  do so. A physical altercation ensued during which Mr. Hodgson used a chokehold  to restrain the guest, who lost consciousness and died. Mr. Hodgson was charged  with second degree murder.The trial judge found that it was proven beyond a  reasonable doubt that Mr. Hodgson caused the guest\u2019s death by placing him in a  chokehold. However, based on her assessment of the evidence, she acquitted Mr.  Hodgson of second degree murder because the Crown failed to establish the  requisite subjective <em>mens rea. </em>A  second degree murder is a murder that is not planned and deliberate. She also  found Mr. Hodgson not guilty of manslaughter. Manslaughter refers to a homicide  committed as a result of a sudden provocation. The trial judge found that Mr.  Hodgson\u2019s defence of self-defence under s. 34 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>had an air of reality and that the Crown had failed  to establish that the chokehold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal of the  acquittal and directed that a new trial be held on the basis that the trial  judge erred in law in her analysis of the <em>mens  rea</em> for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. Mr.  Hodgson appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and restored  the acquittal.<strong>The Crown\u2019s right of appeal from an acquittal is limited to questions of  law alone.</strong>Writing jointly for the majority,  Justices Martin and Moreau noted that the Crown has a limited right of appeal  on questions of law alone when it seeks to overturn an acquittal. A question of  law is a question of legal interpretation that does not involve an evaluation  of the evidence. In this case, the Court of Appeal did not articulate the  precise errors of law at the root of its intervention and it is not a case in  which the appellate court could reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the  evidence without calling into question the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the  evidence. Furthermore, even if the alleged errors were ones of law, the trial  judge did not commit any such errors. Justices Martin and Moreau said  that an inference that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action is  available in some cases. However, it is not an error of law for a trial judge  to reach a different conclusion about a particular accused\u2019s <em>mens rea</em> based on the evidence. The  Justices found there was no error of law in the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the  evidence on the <em>mens rea</em>. As for self-defence, Justices  Martin and Moreau decided that the trial judge followed the framework set out  in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. That is to say,  the trial judge specifically addressed each of its three elements, correctly  stated the applicable statutory principles, applied them to the facts as found,  and expressed clear conclusions on each element.",

    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that a taxpayer should not challenge tax  assessments by applying to the Federal Court for declarations.</strong>In this appeal, the  Supreme Court dealt with a question of jurisdiction. It determined whether a  taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the validity of tax assessments was a matter within the  exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada or whether it could be brought  in the Federal Court. Iris Technologies  Inc. filed Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns claiming tax refunds under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> (\u201cETA\u201d). The Minister of  National Revenue (the Minister) began an audit of the relevant reporting  periods and refused to pay the refunds while the audit was ongoing. The  Minister then issued an assessment denying the tax refund, and assessed  penalties to be paid by Iris. Iris asked the Federal  Court to review the Minister\u2019s assessment. This kind of request is referred to  as an application for judicial review. Iris also asked the Federal Court to  declare (a) that the Minister failed to afford Iris procedural fairness in the  audit and an opportunity to respond to the proposed adjustments; (b) that the  assessments were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to the  findings of fact made by the Minister; and (c) that the assessments were made  for the improper purpose of seeking to deprive the Federal Court of  jurisdiction in a related application. The Attorney  General of Canada brought a motion to strike Iris\u2019 application for judicial  review. The Case Management Judge dismissed the Attorney General\u2019s motion. The  Attorney General appealed that decision to the Federal Court. The Federal Court  dismissed the Attorney General\u2019s appeal, but the Federal Court of Appeal  allowed its subsequent appeal and struck out Iris\u2019 application for judicial  review on the basis that it was, in essence, a collateral challenge to the  validity of the assessments, a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the  Tax Court. Iris appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The matter  should be brought in the Tax Court of Canada.</strong><strong> </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that notwithstanding the issuance of a tax  assessment, the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to conduct judicial  review over discretionary decisions delegated to the Minister by Parliament,  including those that directly affect liability. However, the Minister\u2019s  assessment of net tax pursuant to the <em>ETA</em> is not the exercise of a discretionary power; it is a non-discretionary  determination where the outcome, the assessment, is dictated by statute. Jurisdiction  over the correctness of the assessment falls to the Tax Court under section 302  of the <em>ETA</em>. In the instant  case, two of the claims raised by Iris in its application for judicial review \u2014  those alleging procedural unfairness and a lack of an evidentiary foundation \u2014  are properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court as they are  best characterized as attacks on the correctness of the assessment. Iris\u2019 third  claim, that the Minister acted with an improper purpose, could, in some  circumstances, be the basis for an application for judicial review, but should  be struck because Iris did not allege facts in its application that, if taken  to be true, would give any support to this claim.

    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to a discretionary decision by the Minister of  National Revenue should be brought in Federal Court. </strong>This appeal addressed  whether the Tax Court of Canada had jurisdiction to consider a company\u2019s challenge  to a decision by the Minister of National Revenue. The Minister refused to reduce the company\u2019s taxable income by adjusting the value of a  \u201cnon-arm\u2019s length\u201d transaction that the company had concluded with a foreign  lender. This procedure is called a downward transfer pricing adjustment. A \u201cnon-arm\u2019s length\u201d  transaction is one in which the parties are related to each other. They can  also be between unrelated individuals, partnerships or corporations, depending  on the circumstances. In contrast, an arm\u2019s length transaction is one in which  both parties act in their separate interests. In the tax context, this  distinction is important because when evaluating a transaction between two  companies that are not at arm\u2019s length, meaning they are associated in some  way, the revenue agency wants to ensure it is still collecting tax on the  transaction at the fair market value. The Canadian  company in question, Dow\u00a0Chemical Canada ULC, concluded a non\u2011arm\u2019s length  loan agreement to borrow money from a related Swiss company. As a result of  this loan agreement, Dow incurred interest expenses for its 2006 and 2007  taxation years. It also reported income for the 2006 taxation year in respect  of manufacturing services provided to the Swiss company. Following a review  of the transactions between Dow and the Swiss company, the Minister reassessed  Dow for its 2006 taxation year, applying transfer pricing rules set out in section  247(2) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> (\u201c<em>ITA</em>\u201d). Under section 247(2), where a  taxpayer is dealing with a non-resident person with whom it is not at arm\u2019s  length \u2013 in this case, the Swiss company \u2013 the amounts in a given transaction  will be adjusted to reflect what would have been agreed to had the persons been  dealing with one another at arm\u2019s length. The application of section 247(2)  resulted in a significant increase in Dow\u2019s income in the 2006 taxation year,  meaning it would need to pay more tax on that income.Dow believed that  its income should be decreased. Where an amount is identified that would  decrease the taxpayer\u2019s income, section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> says that a downward adjustment cannot be made unless approved  by the Minister. Dow asked the Minister to allow a downward transfer pricing  adjustment, but the Minister exercised her discretion to refuse Dow\u2019s request. Dow then asked the  Federal Court to review the Minister\u2019s decision. This process is called a  \u201cjudicial review\u201d. Dow also objected to the reassessment for the 2006 taxation  year and eventually appealed the reassessment to the Tax Court.Dow\u2019s appeal asked  whether the Minister\u2019s denial of the request for a downward transfer pricing  adjustment fell outside the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Tax Court. The  Tax Court said that the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is an essential component of the taxpayer\u2019s assessment and goes to the  correctness of that assessment, and may therefore be reviewed by the Tax Court  under its exclusive jurisdiction to determine, on appeal, the correctness of  the assessment. The Minister disagreed and appealed to the Federal Court of  Appeal. The Federal Court  of Appeal allowed the Minister\u2019s appeal and held that the Federal Court has  exclusive jurisdiction to conduct a judicial review of the Minister\u2019s discretionary  decisions under section 247(10). Dow appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The Tax Court did not have jurisdiction to  review the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that when the Minister has exercised her  discretion under section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> to deny a taxpayer\u2019s request for a downward pricing adjustment, that decision  falls outside of the jurisdiction of the Tax Court in respect of an appeal of  the taxpayer\u2019s assessment. The Minister\u2019s discretionary decision is not part of  the assessment. The meaning of \u201cassessment\u201d is settled in law, and the  Minister\u2019s opinion formed under section 247(10) is qualitatively distinct from  that concept. As there is no express right of appeal to the Tax Court, the  proper forum to challenge the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is the Federal Court, pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction in judicial review  under section 18(1) of the <em>Federal Courts  Act</em>. Only the Federal Court has the jurisdiction to apply the appropriate  standard of review and access to the appropriate range of administrative law  remedies.",

Two teachers employed  by an Ontario public school board recorded their private communications  regarding workplace concerns on a shared personal, password-protected log stored  in the cloud. The school principal, who had been made aware of the log, entered the  classroom of one of the teachers to return some teaching materials after  classes had ended. The teacher was not present. The principal noticed that the Board laptop used by the teacher  was open and touched its mousepad. He saw the log that opened on the screen,  read what was visible, then scrolled through the document and took screenshots  with his cellphone. These communications then formed the basis for the school  board to issue written reprimands. \u00a0 The teachers\u2019 union filed a  grievance against the written reprimands issued to the teachers, claiming that  the search violated the teachers\u2019 right to privacy at work. They did not allege  any breach of the <em>Charter</em>. A labour  arbitrator, appointed pursuant to the collective agreement, dismissed the  grievance. The arbitrator found there was no breach of the teachers\u2019 reasonable  expectation of privacy when balanced against the school board\u2019s interest in  managing the workplace.The teachers\u2019 union asked the Divisional  Court to review the arbitrator\u2019s decision. A majority of the Divisional Court held  that the arbitrator\u2019s decision was reasonable. It said that the school  principal\u2019s search did not raise any <em>Charter </em>issues because, unlike in a criminal context, an employee does not have the  right under section of the <em>Charter</em> to  be secure against unreasonable search or seizure in a workplace environment. The teachers\u2019 union appealed to  the Ontario Court of Appeal, which unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed  the arbitrator\u2019s decision. It held that the majority of the Divisional Court made  a mistake in concluding that section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> did not apply. The Court of Appeal held that  school boards are subject to the <em>Charter</em> and that the school principal\u2019s search was unreasonable under section 8. The school  board then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The  Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The <em>Charter </em>applies to Ontario public  school boards. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Rowe said Ontario public school board teachers are protected by section 8 of  the <em>Charter</em> in the workplace, as  these boards are inherently governmental for the purposes of section 32 of the <em>Charter</em>. Section 32 identifies certain  entities that are bound by the <em>Charter</em>,  including federal and provincial legislatures and governments, as well as  entities that are controlled by a government or that perform governmental  functions. Consequently, the grievance at issue implicated an alleged violation  of a <em>Charter </em>right, and section 8 of  the<em> Charter</em> was a legal constraint  bearing on the arbitrator\u2019s analysis. On review, applying the correctness  standard, the arbitrator erred by limiting her inquiry to the arbitral  framework without regard for the legal framework under section that, as a  matter of law, she was required to respect. This error was fatal and the  arbitrator\u2019s decision should be set aside. For these reasons, Justice Rowe dismissed  the appeal. ",

They brought a motion for a stay of proceedings based on abusive state conduct related to the laying of the charges. The trial judge ordered that the motion be heard in camera due to the centrality of Named Person's informer status to the motion. The appeal was also heard in camera, and the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, stayed the conviction, and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings. The Court of Appeal expressed its disagreement with the scope of the confidentiality measures put in place for Named Person's trial.\n\n**Court Proceedings:** The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and other media organizations, as well as the Attorney General of Quebec, applied to the Court of Appeal to review the confidentiality orders made in the case. The Court of Appeal upheld the sealing of all information that might tend to identify Named Person, finding that there was no possibility of disclosing any information that might tend to identify them without risking their safety.\n\n**Legal Principle Established:** The court reaffirmed the importance of the open court principle and the need to protect informer privilege in order to ensure the effectiveness of police investigations and the maintenance of public order.\n\n**Court's Reasoning:** The court found that the trial judge had correctly found that the motion for a stay of proceedings had to be heard in camera due to the centrality of Named Person's informer status to the motion. However, the court erred in its decision not to partially unseal the appeal record to make public a redacted version of the trial judgment. The court also found that the creation of a parallel proceeding with its own record number, which was not done in this case, would have allowed for the disclosure of the existence of an in camera hearing and any decision rendered as a result, while still protecting Named Person's anonymity.",

The Court of Appeal decided to open a record at its  court office, accompanied by a sealing order, and to make public a version of  its decision in which certain information was redacted, that is, blacked out.  In that decision, the Court of Appeal denounced the holding of a \u201csecret  trial\u201d, which alarmed the public and the media. It also expressed its  disagreement with the scope of the confidentiality measures put in place for  the person\u2019s trial.A number of media organizations,  the Attorney General of Quebec and the Chief Judge of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec then  asked the Court of Appeal to review the confidentiality orders made in this  case. In a second decision, the Court of Appeal upheld the sealing of all  information that might tend to identify the person. The Court of Appeal also  refused to partially unseal, or open up, the appeal record by redacting the  same information as in the public version of its decision. The media  organizations and the Attorney General of Quebec appealed that second decision  to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has allowed  their appeals in part.<strong>Court openness is a cardinal principle of the Canadian justice system. Any exception to this principle must be limited.</strong>In a unanimous judgment, the  Court confirmed that no secret trial was held in this case. The Court in fact specified  that \u201cthe very concept of \u2018secret trial\u2019 does not exist in Canada.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  [T]he  cardinal principle of court openness may be tempered where the circumstances of  a case so require. Various confidentiality orders may be made\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.,  up to and including an order that all hearings be held <em>in\u00a0camera</em>\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But it is well established that  \u2018secret trials\u2019, those that leave no trace, are not part of the range of  possible measures.\u201d According to the Supreme Court,  the magnitude of the controversy that arose after the Court of Appeal\u2019s first decision  was released could have been limited if that court had not used the expression  \u201csecret trial\u201d to describe what were actually <em>in\u00a0camera</em> hearings held in a proceeding that began and  initially moved forward publicly.Where, as in this case, an informer asserts their status in a proceeding  that began publicly in which they face charges that do not cause them to lose  their status, and the informer\u2011police relationship is central to the  proceedings, the appropriate way to protect the informer\u2019s anonymity will  generally be to proceed totally <em>in\u00a0camera</em>.  Even in these most confidential of cases, it is still possible \u2014 and even  essential \u2014 to protect the informer\u2019s anonymity while favouring confidentiality  orders that do not entirely or indefinitely keep the existence of a hearing or  judgment from the public. What is in issue is the maintenance of public  confidence in the administration of justice and compliance with the guiding  rule from <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2384/index.do\">Named  Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43</a></em>, which requires a court to protect informer  privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open  court principle.As the Supreme Court noted, when  justice is rendered in secret, without leaving any trace, respect for the rule  of law is jeopardized and public confidence in the administration of justice  may be shaken. The open court principle allows a society to guard against such  risks, which erode the very foundations of democracy. By ensuring the  accountability of the judiciary, court openness supports an administration of  justice that is impartial, fair and in accordance with the rule of law. It also  helps the public gain a better understanding of the justice system and its  participants, which can only enhance public confidence in their integrity.  Court openness is therefore of paramount importance to our democracy \u2014 an  importance that is also reflected in the constitutional protection afforded to  it in Canada. In this case, the Supreme Court found  that the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the motions for disclosure of  the information that had been kept confidential up to that time but that it erred  in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. The case is  therefore remanded to the Court of Appeal so that it can make public a redacted  version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting  the parties concerned on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction.",

    "baseline_summary": "**Summary**\n\nThe court's decision is that the appeal should be allowed and the trial judge's judgment restored, with costs throughout.\n\n**Central Legal Question**\n\nThe central legal question in this case is what qualifies as an express agreement under section 53 of the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) to oust an implied statutory condition, specifically the condition that goods sold by description will correspond with their description.\n\n**Background of the Case**\n\nThe case involves a contract between Pine Valley Enterprises Inc. (Pine Valley) and Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc. (Earthco) for the sale of topsoil. Pine Valley alleged that the topsoil delivered did not meet the compositional specifications indicated in the test results provided by Earthco, and sought damages for breach of contract. The trial judge dismissed Pine Valley's action, finding that the exclusion clauses in the contract were sufficient to oust Earthco's liability under section 14 of the SGA. The Court of Appeal allowed Pine Valley's appeal, finding that the exclusion clauses did not meet the standard of explicit, clear, and direct language required to oust liability for a breach of the implied condition in section 14.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe case was heard at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, where the trial judge dismissed Pine Valley's action. Pine Valley appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which allowed the appeal and substituted a judgment requiring Earthco to pay damages. Earthco appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which allowed the appeal and restored the trial judge's judgment.\n\n**Legal Principle Established**\n\nThe legal principle established in this case is that an express agreement under section 53 of the SGA requires that the parties have expressly and unambiguously used language that signals their intention to override the statute, but does not require the use of explicit, clear, and direct language that refers to the precise legal character of the obligation at issue.\n\n**Court's Reasoning**\n\nThe court's reasoning is that the principles of contractual interpretation and the law concerning exclusion clauses require a flexible approach that focuses on the objective intention of the parties, rather than a strict and technical interpretation of the language used. The court found that the exclusion clauses in the contract were sufficient to oust Earthco's liability under section 14 of the SGA, as they clearly and unambiguously indicated that Pine Valley had waived its right to test and approve the topsoil before it was shipped, and that Earthco would not be responsible for the quality of the material once it left its facility.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies what is required for an exclusion  clause in a contract of sale to exempt the seller from an implied condition  under Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. </strong>This appeal concerned a party\u2019s ability to contract out of an  implied condition of sale under Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale  of Goods Act</em>. Implied conditions are obligations that are automatically  incorporated into a contract unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. The  Supreme Court clarified what was required to show that the parties expressly  agreed to contract out of the implied condition.\u00a0\u00a0 Pine Valley  Enterprises Inc. was hired by the City of Toronto to work on a municipal  project to remediate flooding, which included the removal and replacement of  topsoil for drainage. Pine Valley contacted Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc., a  topsoil provider, to obtain topsoil with a specified composition. Earthco provided  Pine Valley with laboratory reports from different topsoil samples taken about  six weeks prior, and warned against purchasing the topsoil without updated test  results. \u00a0However, Pine Valley had  already missed project deadlines and urgently wanted delivery of the topsoil to  avoid a financial penalty. Pine Valley therefore insisted on immediate  delivery. Pine Valley and Earthco agreed to add two exclusion clauses to their  contract that stated that Pine Valley had the right to test and approve the  material before it was shipped, and that if it waived those rights, Earthco  would not be responsible for the quality of the material once it left its  facility. After the  topsoil was delivered and placed on the project site, water ponding was noted. New  testing revealed that there was substantially more clay in the topsoil than the  initial test results had indicated, and Pine Valley had to remove and replace  the topsoil. Pine Valley then sued Earthco for damages, alleging that it did  not receive topsoil within the range of compositional properties that had been  indicated in the initial test results.The trial judge  dismissed Pine Valley\u2019s action. He found that the contract was for a sale of  goods by description within the meaning of section 14 of Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which sets out an  implied condition that goods must correspond with their description. He agreed  that Pine Valley did not get the topsoil it bargained for, because of the  variation between the topsoil that was promised and the topsoil that was  delivered. However, the trial judge concluded that the exclusion clauses met  the requirements of an \u201cexpress agreement\u201d according to section 53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which allows parties to  contract out of the implied condition under section 14. He concluded as such  despite the fact that the exclusion clauses did not explicitly mention that  they were added to the contract for this purpose. \u00a0The Court of  Appeal disagreed with the trial judge and found that the wording in the  exclusion clauses was insufficient to exempt Earthco from liability under section  14 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. The  Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a judgment requiring Earthco  to pay damages. Earthco appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal.<strong>The exclusion clauses were an express agreement  pursuant to section 53. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin said that to be sufficient for the purposes of section  53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, an  \u201cexpress agreement\u201d must be comprised of an agreement to negative or vary a  statutorily implied right, duty or liability and such an agreement must be  expressly set forth within the parties\u2019 contract. The determination as to what  qualifies as an express agreement must also be informed by principles of  contractual interpretation and the law concerning exclusion clauses, and the  paramount consideration must be the objective intention of the parties. In the instant  case, the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion  clauses at issue. The objective meaning of the parties\u2019 express agreement was that  Pine Valley accepted the risk that the topsoil would not meet the previously  supplied specifications concerning its composition if it failed to test what it  knew was an organic and changing substance. For these reasons, Justice Martin  allowed the appeal and restored the trial judge\u2019s judgment. ",

Prior to the trial, the accused brought a pre-trial application to adduce evidence of prior sexual activity pursuant to ss. 276 and 278.93 of the Criminal Code, but the trial judge dismissed the application.\n\n**Court Proceedings:** The appeal proceeded in camera and the appeal record was sealed. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's decision, while Justice Frankel dissented, finding that the evidence of prior sexual activity was essential to challenging the complainant's credibility. The accused appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Crown brought a motion for the appeal to be held in camera and for the sealing of filed materials.\n\n**Legal Principle Established:** The Court reaffirmed the proper use of other sexual activity evidence for credibility and context purposes, and established that appellate courts should consider the complainant's right to privacy and the interests of justice when limiting court openness.\n\n**Court's Reasoning:** The majority of the Court found that the accused failed to identify a specific use for the prior sexual activity evidence that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and was essential to his ability to make full answer and defence. The Court also found that s. 278.95 does not extend to appellate proceedings, but rather, the Court has implied jurisdiction to control its own processes and records, and may limit court openness in appeals of s. 276 determinations. The Court applied the Sherman Estate test to determine that the benefits of limiting court openness did not outweigh its negative effects on court openness, and ordered a publication ban on certain information related to the complainant's sexual activity instead.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court says a trial court was right to refuse evidence of  prior sexual activity in a sexual assault case. \u00a0\u00a0</strong>The accused was convicted of a sexual assault that  took place on April 2, 2018. The complainant was his spouse, who testified that  her marriage to the accused had completely broken down in February of that  year. However, in an earlier statement to the police, the complainant also  stated that she and the accused had engaged in consensual sexual activity on  the evening of April 1, the night before the sexual assault. Prior to his trial, the accused asked the court to  allow evidence that he and the complainant had engaged in consensual sexual  activity in the evening of April 1 and in the morning of April 2. He argued  that admitting such evidence would serve to challenge the complainant\u2019s  credibility \u2013 specifically with respect to her claim that the marriage had  completely broken down at the time of the alleged assault \u2013 to provide context,  and to support his defence that the complainant had consented to the sexual  activity, as it was all part of one interaction. Under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual activity with the  accused or with any other person is not admissible to support an inference that  the complainant is either (a) more likely to have consented to the sexual  activity at the center of the charge; or (b) is less worthy of belief. In law,  this is called \u201ctwin-myth reasoning\u201d and relying on such inferences is not  allowed.The trial judge dismissed the accused\u2019s application to  admit this evidence. He found no inconsistency between the complainant\u2019s  statement to the police and her testimony. In his view, the evidence the accused  wanted to submit was irrelevant to her credibility \u2013 it would only serve to  support one of the two inferences prohibited under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. As required under section  278.95 of the <em>Criminal </em>Code, the  content of the accused\u2019s application, the hearing that was held to decide the  issue and the trial judge\u2019s decision were subject to a publication ban. The  case went to trial and the accused was ultimately convicted. The accused\u2019s appeal proceeded <em>in camera </em>(closed to the public) and the appeal record was sealed  (not made public). A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia  dismissed the accused\u2019s appeal. It agreed with the trial judge that the accused  had not identified a legitimate use of the proposed evidence. The accused then appealed the decision to the Supreme  Court of Canada. By way of a motion, the Crown relied on section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to ask the Court for an <em>in camera </em>hearing, for filed materials  to be sealed, and for any other order necessary to protect information and  evidence related to the accused\u2019s application to admit evidence on prior sexual  activity. The Court heard oral arguments on the motion before continuing with  the hearing on the appeal. The Supreme Court has dismissed the accused\u2019s appeal  and allowed the Crown\u2019s motion in part. \u00a0\u00a0<strong>The evidence of prior sexual activity was inadmissible at the trial.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin held that the accused failed to  sufficiently identify a specific use for the prior sexual activity evidence  that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and that was essential to his ability  to make full answer and defence. The trial judge did not make a mistake in  denying the application. As such, the accused\u2019s conviction was upheld. With respect to the Crown\u2019s motion, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin determined  that the mandatory publication ban under section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>did not extend to  appellate proceedings. Rather, she said the Supreme Court\u2019s power to make an  order limiting court openness in the instant case was derived from implied  jurisdiction of courts to control their own processes and records. The Court\u2019s  discretion should be exercised in a way that maintains court openness as far as  practicable while protecting the complainant\u2019s personal dignity and privacy and  the accused\u2019s fair trial rights.Justice O\u2019Bonsawin then applied the test set out in <a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2021/38695-eng.pdf\"><em>Sherman Estate v. Donovan</em></a>, a prior unrelated  decision of this Court, to conclude that the circumstances of the instant case  did not justify all of the measures requested by the Crown. Banning publication  of any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity  other than that which formed the subject-matter of the charge was  sufficient.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ",

    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  the convictions of two men guilty of manslaughter.</strong>The issue in these appeals  was whether the trial judge made a mistake in instructing the jury on how to  establish causation between the accused\u2019s unlawful acts and the victim\u2019s death from  stabbing wounds inflicted by a third person. Emanuel Lozada and Victor  Ramos were accused of manslaughter as a result of an unlawful act (known in law  as \u201cunlawful act manslaughter\u201d) after participating in a fight in downtown  Toronto, which resulted in the fatal stabbing of a victim. It was never  suggested that either Mr. Lozada or Mr. Ramos had stabbed the victim. A third person  was convicted of second degree murder for the stabbing. Rather, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos were accused of acting as co-principals in the fatal attack or aiders  and abettors to the stabber. To convict Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos, the Crown needed to establish causation between their unlawful acts \u2013  their participation in the group assault \u2013 and the victim\u2019s death. To do so,  the Crown had to prove that the unlawful acts were a significant contributing  cause to his death. The Crown\u2019s theory was that Mr. Ramos fought with the  victim and punched or kicked him, while Mr. Lozada fought with one of the  victim\u2019s friends. It argued that the two men\u2019s assaults left the victim  vulnerable to being stabbed by the third man. In their defence, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos argued that the stabbing was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence  of their decision to join a fight. As such, the stabbing event broke the chain  of causation between their assaults and the victim\u2019s death and they could not  be held criminally responsible for it. The jury convicted Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos of unlawful act manslaughter. The two men appealed their  convictions together at the Ontario Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial  judge made a mistake when instructing the jury on whether their conduct was a  significant contributing cause of the victim\u2019s death. The majority of the Court  of Appeal dismissed their appeals. It found that when considered in isolation,  two passages from the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on reasonable  foreseeability misstated the law. However, the majority concluded that read as  a whole, the instructions given by the trial judge to the jury were accurate. Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeals.<strong>The jury was accurately instructed on the issue of causation.</strong>Writing for the majority,  Justice Moreau said that on a reading of the jury instructions and the trial  judge\u2019s answers to the jury\u2019s questions as a whole, the instructions conveyed  the proper test for causation: whether the conduct of Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos  was a significant contributing cause of the victim\u2019s death. Moreover, the trial  judge properly equipped the jury with appropriate analytical tools \u2013 i.e. the  question of reasonable foreseeability \u2013 to assist the jury in determining  whether the stabbing could be considered to be an intervening act that would  absolve Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos of legal responsibility for manslaughter. For  these reasons, Justice Moreau dismissed the appeals and upheld the manslaughter  convictions. \u00a0",

Lynch**\n\n**The Court's Decision:** The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal, and restored the application judge's order, ruling that compensation for the expropriation of the Lynch Property should take into account the Watershed zoning and its discretionary uses of agriculture, forestry, and public utility.\n\n**Central Legal Question:** How do zoning regulations and other land use restrictions affect the compensation due to owners of expropriated property?\n\n**Background:** The case involves a property owned by several family members in the Broad Cove River watershed. The City of St. Johns had refused to permit any development on the property due to concerns about water pollution, leading to a finding that the property had been constructively expropriated.\n\n**Court Proceedings:** The parties disagreed on how to assess compensation for expropriation. The City argued that compensation should be based on discretionary agriculture, forestry, and public utility uses permitted by existing zoning regulations. In contrast, respondents contended that they should be compensated as if residential development were permissible.\n\nThe Board of Commissioners referred this question to a special case for opinion before Chaytor J., who concluded that compensation assessment should take account of existing zoning regulations as an independent enactment not part of an expropriation scheme under s 27(1)(a) Expropriation Act RSNL 1990 c E-19.\n\nHowever Green Butler White JJ A reversed Chaytor J decision ordering respondents' compensation determined without reference existing Watershed Zoning Development Regulations\n\nOn appeal from Newfoundland Labrador CA Martin J delivered judgment allowing appeal restoring application judges order\n\n **Legal Principle Established**: Compensation for constructive expropriation is based on market value which naturally flows from objective economic reinstatement; displaced property owners should be put back in same economic position prior to taking no better or worse \n\n **Court's Reasoning**: Martin J emphasized importance considering whether enactments made with view toward taking rather than regulating when assessing market value; causality does not drive inquiry but rather purpose behind regulatory enactments",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies  how zoning regulations and other restrictions on land use affect how owners of  expropriated property are compensated. \u00a0</strong>Expropriation is a forcible acquisition by the Crown  of privately-owned property for public purposes. A \u201cconstructive expropriation\u201d  happens when a public authority acquires private property by using its  regulatory powers. In such cases, the owners can be entitled to compensation  based on the property\u2019s market value. At issue in this case was the Lynch family\u2019s property  in the Broad Cove River watershed in Newfoundland. Groundwater within the  watershed drains towards the Broad Cove River, which is used by the City of St.  John\u2019s for the local water supply. Pursuant to the <em>City of St. John\u2019s Act</em>, the Lynch property is subject to the City\u2019s  pollution control and expropriation powers. In 1994, the Lynch property was  zoned as watershed (the \u201cwatershed zoning\u201d). Within the watershed zone, the  City\u2019s permission is required for any use of the land, and it may only be  granted for three discretionary uses: agriculture, forestry and public utility. Since at least the 1990s, the Lynch family has tried  to obtain permission to develop the property. In 2013, the City rejected a  formal application to develop a residential subdivision on the property, citing  its authority under the <em>City of St.  John\u2019s Act </em>and the property\u2019s designation as part of the watershed zone. Following  that refusal, the Lynch family turned to the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of  Appeal, which declared that the City had expropriated the Lynch property when it  refused to permit any development on it. The court\u2019s decision meant that the  Lynch family was entitled to compensation from the City. The City asked the Board of Commissioners of Public  Utilities to assess how much the Lynch family was owed. In turn, the Board  sought the opinion of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador to  determine whether compensation should be assessed based on the watershed zoning  or whether the watershed zoning should be ignored and the value determined as  if residential development were allowed. This question was important because  valuation according to the watershed zoning would diminish the market value of  the property compared to the Lynch family\u2019s desire to use it for residential  development. As a result, taking the watershed zoning into account would reduce  the compensation owed to the Lynch family.The judge applied a legal principle according to which  changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are ignored in  the compensation assessment. As such, the question became whether the watershed  zoning was made with a view to expropriating the Lynch property. The judge ruled  that the watershed zoning was an independent enactment and not part of the  expropriation scheme. This meant that it could operate to influence the market  value of the Lynch property and was not to be ignored for the purpose of  determining compensation. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal allowed  the Lynch family\u2019s appeal. It disagreed with the first judge and concluded that  the watershed zoning was connected to the expropriation. As such, it ordered  the Board to determine compensation without reference to the watershed zoning. The  City appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.\u00a0 <strong>The watershed  zoning was independent from the expropriation scheme. </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Martin held  that the Lynch family was entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair  compensation for the City\u2019s constructive expropriation of the property. She  agreed with the first judge\u2019s finding that the watershed zoning was an  independent enactment and not made with a view to expropriation. As such,  Justice Martin determined that the market value assessment for the property  must take into account the fact that the watershed zoning limits use of the  property to discretionary agriculture, forestry and public utility. To ignore  the watershed zoning would compensate the Lynch family for something they never  would have had absent the expropriation: unencumbered land to develop  residential housing. For these reasons, Justice Martin allowed the appeal, set  aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restored the first judge\u2019s order. ",

During the judicial process, the judge did not ensure that the appellant was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to the requirements of section 530(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant raised this issue for the first time on appeal.\n\n**Court Proceedings:**\nThe British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the breach of section 530(3) was an error of law, but that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the error had caused any prejudice. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, holding that a breach of section 530(3) is an error of law that gives rise to a presumption that the accused's fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was violated.\n\n**Legal Principle Established:**\nA breach of section 530(3) of the Criminal Code is an error or irregularity that, if it occurred, is subject to a curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv), which may save the conviction only if the Crown can show that the accused would have suffered no prejudice and the trial court, at least, maintained jurisdiction over the class of offences.\n\n**Court's Reasoning:**\nThe majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that a breach of section 530(3) is an error of law that gives rise to a presumption that the accused's fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was violated. The Crown can rebut this presumption by showing that the accused would have chosen to be tried in the language in which their trial was conducted or that they had timely knowledge of their right to be tried in the other official language. The court also held that the curative proviso in section 686(1)(b)(iv) can be applied if the Crown implicitly raises it by arguing that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred or that the evidence of guilt is so overwhelming that the verdict would have been the same.\n\nIn dissent, Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. held that a breach of section 530(3) does not give rise to a question of law alone, nor does it concern a decision by a trial judge, and therefore falls within the residual category of s. 686(1)(a)(iii). They also held that the appellant must provide evidence to show that non-compliance with s. 530(3) had an actual consequence on their right to choose the language at trial.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial in French for an accused person who was not informed  of his right to be tried in the official language of his choice.\u00a0 </strong>This case was about the  analytical framework that a court of appeal must apply when an accused person appeals  their conviction because they were not informed of their right to be tried in  the official language of their choice the first time they appeared before a  judge, where no decision on their language rights was made at first instance.Section\u00a0530 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>guarantees to every  accused person the right to be tried in the official language of their choice. To  make certain that the accused\u2019s choice is free and informed, section\u00a0530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> imposes a duty on the  judge before whom the accused first appears to ensure that the accused is  advised of their right and of the time before which they must apply for a trial  before a judge or a judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official  language of their choice.Franck Yvan Tayo Tompouba is a  bilingual Francophone who was convicted of sexual assault following a trial  conducted in English in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. During the  judicial process leading to Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba\u2019s conviction, the judge did  not ensure that he was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to  the requirements of section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>. Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba did not apply for a trial in French or  raise the breach of his right to be advised of his right to make such an  application.Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba appealed  his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. It was then that he asserted  for the first time that he would have liked his trial to be conducted in French.  Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba alleged that his language rights had been violated due,  among other things, to the fact that the judge had breached his duty under  section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed his  appeal. While it was of the view that the judge\u2019s breach was an error of law  that warranted its intervention, it found that the evidence did not make it  possible to decide certain key questions, including when Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba  had learned of his fundamental right, whether he would in fact have chosen a  trial in French if he had had an opportunity to do so, and whether he had not  made a free and informed choice to have a trial in English. It therefore found  that the evidence was insufficient and that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba had not met  the burden of persuading it that the judge\u2019s breach of the duty set out in section\u00a0530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> had resulted in a violation  of his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba appealed  the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, which has allowed his appeal.<strong>The Court of Appeal erred in imposing on Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba the  burden of proving that his fundamental right had been violated at first  instance.\u00a0 </strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice\u00a0Wagner stated that section\u00a0530(3) imposes a two\u2011pronged  informational duty on the judge before whom an accused first appears: to ensure  that the accused is duly informed of their fundamental right and of how it is  to be exercised, and, where the circumstances so require, to take the necessary  steps to inform the accused of this.  Chief Justice Wagner affirmed that a breach of this informational duty is an  error of law warranting appellate intervention under section\u00a0686(1)(a) of  the <em>Code</em>. As he explained, this  breach, once established, taints the trial court\u2019s judgment and gives rise to a  presumption that the accused\u2019s fundamental right to be tried in the official  language of their choice, which is guaranteed to the accused by section\u00a0530  of the <em>Code</em>, was violated. The Crown  can then rebut this presumption for the purposes of the analysis under the  curative proviso in section\u00a0686(1)(b)(iv) of the <em>Code</em>, which allows a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal where an  error or irregularity shown by the accused did not cause them any prejudice.In this case,  Chief\u00a0Justice\u00a0Wagner concluded, first, that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba had  proved that an error reviewable on appeal had been made and, second, that the  Crown had failed to establish that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba\u2019s fundamental right had  not in fact been violated despite the judge\u2019s breach of his informational duty  under section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.  For these reasons, Chief\u00a0Justice\u00a0Wagner allowed the appeal, quashed Mr.\u00a0Tayo  Tompouba\u2019s conviction and ordered that a new trial be held in French.",

    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court holds  that the military status of military judges does not violate the constitutional  guarantee of judicial independence to which persons tried before courts martial  are entitled. </strong>These appeals are about whether the requirement under  the <em>National Defence Act</em> that military  judges be military officers violates the right to a hearing by an independent  and impartial tribunal guaranteed under Section 11(d) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  \u00a0The appeals were brought by nine members of the  Canadian Armed Forces who were accused of various service offences under the  Code of Service Discipline, which forms part of the <em>National Defence Act</em>. Service offences, which include offences  specific to military personnel and offences under the <em>Criminal Code </em>and other Canadian laws, are tried before a court  martial, a military court that has the same powers, rights, and privileges as a  superior court of criminal jurisdiction. Courts martial are presided over by  military judges, who are required by the <em>National  Defence Act </em>to have been lawyers and military officers for at least 10  years. As officers, military judges are part of the chain of command. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the courts martial, most of the nine accused members  challenged the requirement under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>that the military judges presiding over their courts martial be  officers. They argued that this requirement violates their right to a hearing  by an independent and impartial tribunal under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. The divided loyalties of  military judges as judge and officer were said to deflect them from a proper  exercise of their judicial duties and leaves them vulnerable to pressures from  the chain of command.Under Canadian law, courts must evaluate independence  and impartiality under Section 11(d) by asking whether an informed and  reasonable person would perceive the tribunal at issue as independent. In the  courts martial, some of the military judges held that they lacked judicial  independence because of their dual status of judge and officer, and that for  this reason, the accused members\u2019 Section 11(d) rights were infringed. The  Court Martial Appeal Court disagreed, and said that an informed person, viewing  the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through,  would conclude that military judges are sufficiently impartial and independent  to meet the requirement under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter. </em>Therefore, the accused members\u2019 rights were not infringed.

He held that as presently configured in the <em>National Defence Act</em>, Canada\u2019s system of military justice fully  ensures judicial independence for military judges in a way that takes account  of the military context, and specifically of the legislative policies of  maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the forces and public trust in  a disciplined armed forces.

The Blood Tribe claimed that the reserve's size did not match the promised entitlement, and after a lengthy negotiation process, commenced an action in the Federal Court in 1980.

However, the Court also held that declaratory relief was warranted in this case, given the longevity and magnitude of the Crown's dishonourable conduct towards the Blood Tribe, and that such relief would serve an important role in clarifying the Blood Tribe's treaty land entitlement, identifying the Crown's dishonourable conduct, and assisting future reconciliation efforts.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an Indigenous tribe\u2019s treaty  land entitlement claim is statute-barred, but that declaratory relief is  warranted given the longevity and magnitude of the Crown\u2019s dishonorable  conduct.</strong>This appeal is about whether the breach of an Indigenous tribe\u2019s  treaty land entitlement was actionable in Canadian courts before the coming  into force of section 35(1) of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1982</em>, which recognized and affirmed the existing Aboriginal and treaty  rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.<strong></strong>The Blood Tribe are a member tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy of  First Nations. In 1877, Treaty No. 7 was made between the Crown and the  Confederacy. Treaty No. 7 established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148, the largest  reserve in Canada and the home of the Blood Tribe. The reserve\u2019s size was to be  set by the treaty land entitlement (\u201cTLE\u201d) provisions, based on a formula  promising one square mile for each family of five persons, or in that  proportion for larger and smaller families.The Blood Tribe has long claimed  that the size of the reserve did not respect the TLE formula. In 1971, a Blackfoot  researcher gathered information on the total number of people in the Blood  Tribe for the years 1879 to 1884 and, based on this information, confirmed that  the existing reserve boundaries did not match the boundaries owed under the TLE  formula. The Blood Tribe formally sought to negotiate with the Minister of  Indian Affairs, who rejected its claims. In 1980, the Chief at the time, Jim Shot Both Sides, commenced an  action together with others on behalf of the Blood Tribe in the Federal Court.  They alleged breaches of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment,  and negligence, and sought declaratory relief and damages for breach of  contract arising from the Crown\u2019s failure to fulfil the TLE according to the  prescribed formula (the \u201cTLE Claim\u201d). Declaratory relief is a determination of  a party\u2019s rights without other consequences.The trial judge dismissed all  claims except the TLE Claim, concluding that the Crown had miscalculated the  size of the reserve by underestimating the Blood Tribe\u2019s membership, and stated  that the Crown\u2019s conduct during the reserve\u2019s creation was unconscionable. The  trial judge found that although the facts underlying the TLE Claim were  discoverable in 1971 or shortly thereafter, the applicable six-year limitation  period did not begin to run until 1982, when the enactment of section 35(1) of  the Constitution Act, 1982 created a new cause of action for treaty breaches. The  remedies sought for the TLE Claim were therefore not statute-barred because the  action was commenced in 1980. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal and held that  the TLE Claim was statute-barred. In its view, section 35(1) did not create new  treaty rights, and a remedy was available for the TLE Claim prior to 1982  regardless of the framed cause of action. The Blood Tribe appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part and issued declaratory  relief.<strong>Section 35(1) of the  Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach of treaty  rights.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin explained that section  35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach  of treaty rights. Treaty rights flow from the treaty, not the Constitution, and  treaties are enforceable upon execution and give rise to actionable duties  under the common law. Accordingly, the Blood Tribe\u2019s TLE Claim was enforceable  at common law and actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1).  The Blood Tribe did not contest the trial judge\u2019s finding that the TLE Claim  was discoverable as early as 1971 or that the action was not commenced until  1980. As such, the TLE Claim is statute-barred by operation of the applicable  six-year limitation period.However, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin concluded that declaratory  relief is warranted in this case given the longevity and magnitude of the  Crown\u2019s dishonorable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. She wrote, \u201c[it] will  serve an important role in clarifying the Blood Tribe\u2019s TLE, identifying the  Crown\u2019s dishonourable conduct, assisting future reconciliation efforts, and  helping to restore the honour of the Crown.\u201d",

    "baseline_summary": "**Court's Decision:** The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal, upholding the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal, which had allowed the appeal in part and struck the order compelling the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense (HMOD) to comply with the ICC Arbitral Tribunal's final award.\n\n**Central Legal Question:** The central legal question in this case is whether the fraudulent conduct of a third party to a letter of credit can be attributed to the beneficiary of the letter of credit, thereby requiring the issuing bank to refuse a demand for payment under the fraud exception.\n\n**Background:** The case involves a complex international commercial transaction between Bombardier inc. and the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense (HMOD) for the purchase of firefighting amphibious aircraft. The transaction was secured by a letter of credit issued by a Greek bank, Eurobank Ergasias S.A., in favor of HMOD, and a counter-guarantee issued by the National Bank of Canada in favor of Eurobank. The letter of credit and counter-guarantee were governed by different laws, with the letter of credit governed by Greek law and the counter-guarantee governed by Quebec law.\n\n**Court Proceedings:** The case began with an arbitration proceeding between Bombardier and HMOD, which resulted in a final award declaring the Offsets Contract null and void ab initio. Bombardier then sought an injunction in the Quebec Superior Court to prevent the National Bank from honoring a demand for payment by Eurobank under the counter-guarantee. The trial judge granted the injunction, and the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the decision, striking the order compelling HMOD to comply with the ICC Arbitral Tribunal's final award.\n\n**Legal Principle Established:** The Supreme Court of Canada established that the fraudulent conduct of a third party to a letter of credit can be attributed to the beneficiary of the letter of credit, thereby requiring the issuing bank to refuse a demand for payment under the fraud exception, if the beneficiary has knowledge of the fraud and participates in it.\n\n**Court's Reasoning:** The court held that the trial judge's finding that HMOD engaged in fraud was entitled to deference, and that Eurobank had clear knowledge of HMOD's fraud and participated in it by paying HMOD under the letter of credit. The court also held that the fraud exception applies to the counter-guarantee, and that the National Bank was rightly enjoined from paying Eurobank under the counter-guarantee. The court rejected Eurobank's argument that the Greek courts' decisions should be given weight, holding that the Greek courts' decisions were not binding on the Quebec courts and did not have any decisive relevance to the case.",
    "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court confirms that a Canadian bank must refuse payment to the beneficiary of a  letter of credit due to fraud. </strong>In this appeal, the Court addressed  the issue of whether a Canadian bank was required to refuse payment to the  beneficiary of a letter of credit because of a third party\u2019s fraudulent  behaviour, which was attributable to the beneficiary. In 1998, Bombardier Inc., a  Canadian aviation company based in Montreal, concluded a procurement contract  with the Hellenic Ministry of Defence (HMOD) in Greece for the sale of 10  firefighting airplanes. They also concluded a second contract pursuant to which  Bombardier agreed to subcontract some of the work associated with the airplane procurement  to Greek companies. That contract said that if, at the end of a 10-year term,  Bombardier did not fulfil its subcontracting obligation, it would owe HMOD a  certain amount of money relative to the main contract. To secure payment of the money  Bombardier might owe HMOD under the second contract, the Greek bank at the time  (now Eurobank Ergasias S.A., or, Eurobank) issued a letter of credit guaranteeing  that Eurobank would pay if Bombardier did not (the Letter of Guarantee). For  its part, Eurobank obtained a letter of credit from the National Bank of Canada  to secure a reimbursement in the amount that it would need to pay HMOD under  the Letter of Guarantee if the latter claimed that Bombardier failed to perform  its obligations under the second contract (the Letter of Counter-Guarantee). In  short, the letters would work as follows: if HMOD asked Eurobank to honour the  Letter of Guarantee, Eurobank would then be entitled to turn to the National  Bank to reimburse it under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.A dispute eventually arose  between HMOD and Bombardier with respect to the latter\u2019s subcontracting  obligations. HMOD demanded payment from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee.  In response, Bombardier asked the Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec for an order to stop  the National Bank from honouring a subsequent demand for repayment by Eurobank  under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier alleged that HMOD, a third  party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, committed fraud by demanding payment  before the dispute was resolved by the planned arbitration procedure and that,  because of Eurobank\u2019s knowledge and participation in the fraud, the National  Bank should be prevented from needing to repay Eurobank on the basis of the  \u201cfraud exception\u201d. Under Canadian law, banks have a nearly absolute obligation to  pay the beneficiary of a letter of credit when a valid  demand is made, except when the  beneficiary has committed fraud and it is brought to the bank\u2019s attention  before payment. In this case, Bombardier argued that given HMOD\u2019s fraudulent  conduct, Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was,  by extension, also fraudulent. The Superior Court rejected  Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee on the  basis of the fraud exception. It held that the manner in which HMOD obtained  payment under the Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent, and that Eurobank\u2019s own  conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of  which it was aware. It therefore concluded the National Bank was not required  to repay Eurobank. A majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal agreed and  dismissed the appeal. Eurobank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. \u00a0<strong>The fraud exception applies with respect to Eurobank\u2019s demand for  payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Kasirer explained that because Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud committed by HMOD, that  fraud could be attributed to it as though it was its own. The requirement that  there be fraud by the beneficiary to apply the fraud exception was therefore  met. Moreover, there was no question that Eurobank\u2019s fraud was brought to the  attention of the National Bank as the insurer of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee. On that basis, Justice Kasirer concluded that the National  Bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under  the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank and the majority of the Court of  Appeal made no mistake in that conclusion.",
