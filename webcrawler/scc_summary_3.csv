2024 SCC 12,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an Indigenous tribe’s treaty  land entitlement claim is statute-barred, but that declaratory relief is  warranted given the longevity and magnitude of the Crown’s dishonorable  conduct.</strong>This appeal is about whether the breach of an Indigenous tribe’s  treaty land entitlement was actionable in Canadian courts before the coming  into force of section 35(1) of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1982</em>, which recognized and affirmed the existing Aboriginal and treaty  rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.<strong></strong>The Blood Tribe are a member tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy of  First Nations. In 1877, Treaty No. 7 was made between the Crown and the  Confederacy. Treaty No. 7 established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148, the largest  reserve in Canada and the home of the Blood Tribe. The reserve’s size was to be  set by the treaty land entitlement (“TLE”) provisions, based on a formula  promising one square mile for each family of five persons, or in that  proportion for larger and smaller families.The Blood Tribe has long claimed  that the size of the reserve did not respect the TLE formula. In 1971, a Blackfoot  researcher gathered information on the total number of people in the Blood  Tribe for the years 1879 to 1884 and, based on this information, confirmed that  the existing reserve boundaries did not match the boundaries owed under the TLE  formula. The Blood Tribe formally sought to negotiate with the Minister of  Indian Affairs, who rejected its claims. In 1980, the Chief at the time, Jim Shot Both Sides, commenced an  action together with others on behalf of the Blood Tribe in the Federal Court.  They alleged breaches of the Crown’s fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment,  and negligence, and sought declaratory relief and damages for breach of  contract arising from the Crown’s failure to fulfil the TLE according to the  prescribed formula (the “TLE Claim”). Declaratory relief is a determination of  a party’s rights without other consequences.The trial judge dismissed all  claims except the TLE Claim, concluding that the Crown had miscalculated the  size of the reserve by underestimating the Blood Tribe’s membership, and stated  that the Crown’s conduct during the reserve’s creation was unconscionable. The  trial judge found that although the facts underlying the TLE Claim were  discoverable in 1971 or shortly thereafter, the applicable six-year limitation  period did not begin to run until 1982, when the enactment of section 35(1) of  the Constitution Act, 1982 created a new cause of action for treaty breaches. The  remedies sought for the TLE Claim were therefore not statute-barred because the  action was commenced in 1980. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and held that  the TLE Claim was statute-barred. In its view, section 35(1) did not create new  treaty rights, and a remedy was available for the TLE Claim prior to 1982  regardless of the framed cause of action. The Blood Tribe appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part and issued declaratory  relief.<strong>Section 35(1) of the  Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach of treaty  rights.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice O’Bonsawin explained that section  35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach  of treaty rights. Treaty rights flow from the treaty, not the Constitution, and  treaties are enforceable upon execution and give rise to actionable duties  under the common law. Accordingly, the Blood Tribe’s TLE Claim was enforceable  at common law and actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1).  The Blood Tribe did not contest the trial judge’s finding that the TLE Claim  was discoverable as early as 1971 or that the action was not commenced until  1980. As such, the TLE Claim is statute-barred by operation of the applicable  six-year limitation period.However, Justice O’Bonsawin concluded that declaratory  relief is warranted in this case given the longevity and magnitude of the  Crown’s dishonorable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. She wrote, “[it] will  serve an important role in clarifying the Blood Tribe’s TLE, identifying the  Crown’s dishonourable conduct, assisting future reconciliation efforts, and  helping to restore the honour of the Crown.”"
2024 SCC 11,"<strong>The Supreme  Court confirms that a Canadian bank must refuse payment to the beneficiary of a  letter of credit due to fraud. </strong>In this appeal, the Court addressed  the issue of whether a Canadian bank was required to refuse payment to the  beneficiary of a letter of credit because of a third party’s fraudulent  behaviour, which was attributable to the beneficiary. In 1998, Bombardier Inc., a  Canadian aviation company based in Montreal, concluded a procurement contract  with the Hellenic Ministry of Defence (HMOD) in Greece for the sale of 10  firefighting airplanes. They also concluded a second contract pursuant to which  Bombardier agreed to subcontract some of the work associated with the airplane procurement  to Greek companies. That contract said that if, at the end of a 10-year term,  Bombardier did not fulfil its subcontracting obligation, it would owe HMOD a  certain amount of money relative to the main contract. To secure payment of the money  Bombardier might owe HMOD under the second contract, the Greek bank at the time  (now Eurobank Ergasias S.A., or, Eurobank) issued a letter of credit guaranteeing  that Eurobank would pay if Bombardier did not (the Letter of Guarantee). For  its part, Eurobank obtained a letter of credit from the National Bank of Canada  to secure a reimbursement in the amount that it would need to pay HMOD under  the Letter of Guarantee if the latter claimed that Bombardier failed to perform  its obligations under the second contract (the Letter of Counter-Guarantee). In  short, the letters would work as follows: if HMOD asked Eurobank to honour the  Letter of Guarantee, Eurobank would then be entitled to turn to the National  Bank to reimburse it under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.A dispute eventually arose  between HMOD and Bombardier with respect to the latter’s subcontracting  obligations. HMOD demanded payment from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee.  In response, Bombardier asked the Superior Court of Québec for an order to stop  the National Bank from honouring a subsequent demand for repayment by Eurobank  under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier alleged that HMOD, a third  party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, committed fraud by demanding payment  before the dispute was resolved by the planned arbitration procedure and that,  because of Eurobank’s knowledge and participation in the fraud, the National  Bank should be prevented from needing to repay Eurobank on the basis of the  “fraud exception”. Under Canadian law, banks have a nearly absolute obligation to  pay the beneficiary of a letter of credit when a valid  demand is made, except when the  beneficiary has committed fraud and it is brought to the bank’s attention  before payment. In this case, Bombardier argued that given HMOD’s fraudulent  conduct, Eurobank’s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was,  by extension, also fraudulent. The Superior Court rejected  Eurobank’s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee on the  basis of the fraud exception. It held that the manner in which HMOD obtained  payment under the Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent, and that Eurobank’s own  conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of  which it was aware. It therefore concluded the National Bank was not required  to repay Eurobank. A majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal agreed and  dismissed the appeal. Eurobank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal.  <strong>The fraud exception applies with respect to Eurobank’s demand for  payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Kasirer explained that because Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud committed by HMOD, that  fraud could be attributed to it as though it was its own. The requirement that  there be fraud by the beneficiary to apply the fraud exception was therefore  met. Moreover, there was no question that Eurobank’s fraud was brought to the  attention of the National Bank as the insurer of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee. On that basis, Justice Kasirer concluded that the National  Bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under  the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank and the majority of the Court of  Appeal made no mistake in that conclusion."
2024 SCC 10,"<strong>The Supreme Court upholds a First Nation’s  requirement that its leaders must live on its traditional territory. </strong>This appeal dealt with the question of whether the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>applied  to an election rule enacted by a self-governing First Nation in the Yukon. It  also addressed whether that rule unjustifiably infringed a member’s right to  equality under Section 15 of the <em>Charter</em>.  To answer the second question, the Supreme Court needed to determine whether upholding  the individual’s equality right “abrogated” or “derogated from” (in other  words, abolished or diminished) a protected Aboriginal, treaty or other right or  freedom belonging to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, as stated under Section  25 of the <em>Charter</em>.  The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (“VGFN”) is a self-governing  Indigenous community in the Yukon. Its seat of government is based in Old Crow,  a village located about 800 kilometers north of Whitehorse in the traditional  territory of the Vuntut Gwitchin and constituting the VGFN’s main community in its settlement  land. VGFN has its own Constitution, as well as  electoral rules and standards. One of these rules requires that the elected  Chief and Councillors reside on the settlement land of the First Nation, or  relocate there within 14 days of their election.Cindy Dickson is a member of the VGFN and a citizen of Canada. She  lives in Whitehorse and is constrained for personal reasons to stay there. She wanted  to stand for election as a Councillor of VGFN and said that the residency  requirement discriminated against her as a non-resident of the settlement land.  She challenged the residency requirement before the Yukon Supreme Court,  arguing that it violated her right to equality guaranteed under Section 15(1)  of the <em>Charter</em>.       In response, the VGFN relied on Section 32(1) of the <em>Charter</em>, which identifies certain  entities that are bound by it, including federal and provincial legislatures  and governments, as well as entities that are controlled by a government or  that perform governmental functions. As a self-governing Indigenous community,  the VGFN said that it did not fit the definition and scope of a “government”  under Section 32(1), and therefore, was not bound by the <em>Charter</em>. As such, the residency requirement fell outside the <em>Charter</em>’s application. Alternatively, the VGFN argued that if it were bound by the <em>Charter</em>, the residency requirement did  not violate Ms. Dickson’s right to equality, and, even if it did, the  requirement was protected by Section 25 of the <em>Charter</em>. Section 25 states that the guarantee in the <em>Charter </em>of certain rights and freedoms must  not be interpreted so as to abrogate or derogate from any Aboriginal, treaty or  other rights or freedoms that belong to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada. According  to the VGFN, the residency requirement protected collective minority rights  relating to its traditional Indigenous modes of government and leadership. As  such, it could not be defeated by Ms. Dickson’s individual <em>Charter </em>right. The Yukon Supreme Court agreed that the <em>Charter </em>applied to the VGFN, but that if the residency requirement  infringed Ms. Dickson’s equality right, it was still protected by Section 25 of  the <em>Charter</em>. As a result, Ms.  Dickson’s challenge was rejected. The Yukon Court of Appeal also agreed. Ms.  Dickson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada on the question of the  constitutional validity of the residency requirement, and the VGFN cross-appealed  on the question of the application of the <em>Charter</em>.   The Supreme Court has dismissed Ms. Dickson’s appeal and the VGFN’s cross-appeal. <strong>The residency requirement  is protected as an “other” right or freedom under section 25 of the <em>Charter </em>because it preserves “Indigenous  difference”.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal held  that the <em>Charter</em> applied to the VGFN,  but Ms. Dickson’s Section 15 <em>Charter </em>challenge  failed and the residency requirement was upheld, because of the operation of  Section 25.The <em>Charter </em>applied to the  VGFN, principally because it is a government by nature pursuant to Section  32(1). Furthermore, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal determined that Ms.  Dickson had succeeded in showing that the residency requirement constituted a <em>prima facie </em>(or, on its face) infringement  of her right to equality under Section 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>. However, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal said that the residency  requirement was an exercise of an “other” right or freedom that pertains to the  Aboriginal peoples of Canada under Section 25 of the <em>Charter</em>. As they explained, the purpose of Section 25 is to uphold  certain collective rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples when those  collective rights conflict with an individual’s <em>Charter </em>rights. They declared that the residency requirement  protects “Indigenous difference”, understood as interests connected to  Aboriginal cultural difference, Aboriginal prior occupancy, Aboriginal prior  sovereignty, or Aboriginal participation in the treaty process. “Requiring VGFN  leaders to reside on settlement land helps preserve the leaders’ connection to  the land, which is deeply rooted in the VGFN’s distinctive culture and  governance practices. It also bolsters the VGFN’s ability to resist the outside  forces that pull citizens away from its settlement land […]. Such interests are  associated with various aspects of Indigenous difference . . .”Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal concluded that Ms. Dickson’s claim  based on her Section 15 right to equality abrogated or derogated from this “other”  right under Section 25, which created an irreconcilable conflict between the  two. As such, pursuant to Section 25 of the <em>Charter</em>,  her claim could not be given effect."
2024 SCC 9,"<strong>The Supreme  Court upholds a man’s conviction for dangerous driving causing bodily harm.</strong>The  issue in the appeal was whether a judge presiding over a dangerous driving  trial rendered an unreasonable decision on the basis of inferences that were  illogical and clearly contradicted by the evidence. Gabriel  Boudreau was convicted of dangerous driving causing bodily harm as a result of  a collision between his vehicle and the complainant’s on a Québec City highway  in 2017. Mr. Boudreau’s vehicle rear‑ended the complainant’s vehicle. The  complainant suffered a cervical dorsal sprain, the symptoms of which persisted at  the time of the trial four years later.The  complainant and Mr. Boudreau gave contradictory versions of the events.  The complainant stated that, at the time of the collision, she was driving in the  left lane because of the slow traffic in the right lane when Mr. Boudreau’s  vehicle forcefully struck hers from behind. As for Mr. Boudreau, he  admitted that he had been driving over the speed limit but said that he had slowed  down prior to the collision because traffic on the highway had become heavier.  According to him, the accident occurred because the complainant suddenly moved  into the left lane without signalling and he was unable to avoid it.In finding  that Mr. Boudreau had been driving erratically prior to the collision, the  judge relied on three witness accounts and a video obtained from a department  of transport camera that showed Mr. Boudreau driving before his vehicle climbed  a hill and went out of camera range. However, because the collision itself  could not be seen on the video, the judge had only the accounts given by the  complainant and Mr. Boudreau available to her to determine what had  happened at the moment of impact. She found that Mr. Boudreau’s version of  events, according to which the complainant had quickly pulled into the left  lane, was inconsistent with the report assessing the damage caused to the  complainant’s vehicle, as the report indicated damage not just to the left rear  corner of the vehicle but to the entire rear structure. The judge reasoned that  if the complainant had suddenly moved into the left lane, the damage would have  been on the left side of her vehicle, not the rear. The judge therefore  accepted the complainant’s version of events and convicted Mr. Boudreau.Mr. Boudreau  appealed his conviction to the Quebec Court of Appeal. He argued that the trial  judge had made errors in assessing the evidence and that those errors had led  to an unreasonable decision. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the  appeal.One Court of Appeal judge dissented. She would have allowed the appeal, set aside the  conviction and ordered a new trial. In her view, the trial judge had made two  errors that had led to an  unreasonable decision. First, the trial judge had wrongly rejected Mr. Boudreau’s  testimony on the basis of an illogical inference, namely that if the complainant had suddenly changed lanes, the impact  would have occurred on the left side of the car, not the left rear corner. In  the dissenting judge’s opinion, Mr. Boudreau’s version of events was  perfectly consistent with the location of the damage, that is, the rear of the  vehicle, particularly the left rear corner. Second, she was of the view that  the trial judge’s finding that the complainant had been driving in the left lane well  before the impact was contradicted by the testimony of the complainant herself,  who stated that she had moved into the left lane because of congestion in the  right lane.Mr. Boudreau  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.<strong>The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. </strong>As a  result, the conviction is upheld.<strong></strong>Justice  Côté read the judgment of the Court.

2024 SCC 8,"<strong>The Supreme Court  clarifies the approach to judicial review where a right of appeal is limited by  statute to questions of law. </strong>This appeal concerned the  proper approach to judicial review where there is a limited statutory right of  appeal. It also addressed whether it was reasonable for Ontario’s Licence  Appeal Tribunal (the Tribunal) to deny, in this case, an insured person’s  request for benefits as time-barred.  Ummugulsum Yatar was  injured in a car accident in Ontario in 2010. Her insurer, TD Insurance Meloche  Monnex, initially paid her the accident benefits to which she was entitled  under Ontario’s insurance legislation scheme. However, in January 2011, the  insurer stopped making those payments because she failed to provide a completed  disability certificate. Her income replacement benefits were reinstated briefly  in February, but were again denied in September of that year. Ms. Yatar contested the  denial of her benefits before the Tribunal, which is an administrative body  mandated by the provincial government to resolve, among other things, disputes  about an insured person’s entitlement to motor vehicle accident benefits under  the province’s insurance legislation scheme. The Tribunal dismissed her  application because it was filed too late. Her subsequent request that the Tribunal  reconsider its decision was also dismissed (the reconsideration decision).Ms. Yatar decided to appeal  the Tribunal’s reconsideration decision to the Divisional Court, a branch of  the Ontario Superior Court. Appeals are usually brought by a dissatisfied party  before a higher court to review the decision of a lower court. However,  legislation can sometimes provide a right to appeal decisions made by an  administrative body like the Licence Appeal Tribunal. This is referred to as a  “statutory right of appeal”, as it derives from a statute (a law). According to  the legislation that governed the Licence Appeal Tribunal, Ms. Yatar had a  right to appeal the Tribunal’s reconsideration decision, but it was limited to alleged  errors by the Tribunal on questions of law. Whereas questions of fact are about  what actually took place between the parties, questions of law are about what  the correct legal test is to apply in a given case.  At the same time, Ms. Yatar  brought an application for judicial review before the Divisional Court.  Judicial review is different from an appeal. It is a process by which courts  review decisions by administrative bodies to make sure they uphold procedural  fairness and are reasonable, meaning they make sense in light of the law and  the facts of the case. Ms. Yatar’s application for judicial review contained  questions of fact or mixed fact and law. These questions pertain to the  application of the law to the facts of a case.The Divisional Court  dismissed Ms. Yatar’s appeal, holding that she failed to show that the Tribunal  made an error of law in its reconsideration decision. It also dismissed her  application for judicial review, stating there were no “exceptional”  circumstances that would justify judicial review in this case. Ms. Yatar appealed the  Divisional Court’s decision to dismiss her application for judicial review to  the Ontario Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal. In its  view, judicial review would only be available in “rare” cases, given the  existing legislative scheme to resolve these disputes, including the right to  ask for reconsideration of the Tribunal’s preliminary decision and the  statutory right of appeal on questions of law. It concluded that the  legislature had intended to limit recourse to courts on other questions arising  from the administrative decision. Ms. Yatar appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has  allowed the appeal. <strong>Judicial review was available to Ms. Yatar for issues not dealt with  under the statutory right of appeal. </strong>Writing for a unanimous  Court, Justice Rowe held that a right of appeal does not preclude an individual  from seeking judicial review for questions not dealt with in the appeal. As he  explained, where there is a statutory right of appeal limited to questions of  law, judicial review is available for questions of fact or mixed fact and  law.  Justice Rowe determined  that it was an error for the courts below to hold that, where there is a  limited right of appeal, judicial review should only be exercised in  exceptional or rare cases. The limited right of appeal from the Tribunal’s  decisions to pure questions of law does not reflect an intention by the  legislature to restrict recourse to courts on other questions arising from the  Tribunal’s administrative decisions. It only denotes an intention to subject  the Tribunal’s decisions on questions of law to correctness review, and  proceeding with judicial review on questions of fact or mixed fact and law is  fully respectful of the legislature’s institutional design choices.Finally, Justice Rowe held  that the Tribunal’s reconsideration decision was unreasonable. Among other  reasons, it failed to have regard to the effect of the reinstatement of the  income replacement benefits between February and September 2011 on the validity  of the initial denial. As such, Justice Rowe allowed the appeal and referred  the matter back to the Tribunal for reconsideration. "
2024 SCC 7,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  credibility and reliability findings by judges in separate criminal trials and restores  the convictions of two men guilty of sexual assault.  </strong>These appeals dealt with the question of how credibility  and reliability assessments by judges in criminal trials should be reviewed on  appeal. They also addressed the role of common sense when assessing the  evidence of witnesses. Christopher James Kruk and Edwin Tsang were convicted  of sexual assault in British Columbia in separate and unrelated cases. In both  cases, the British Columbia Court of Appeal overturned their convictions  because of alleged errors in the way the trial judges assessed the credibility  and reliability of the complainants and the accused. The Court of Appeal found  that the trial judges had made assumptions about human behaviour that were not supported  by the evidence, which led the trial judges to believe the complainants and reject  Mr. Kruk’s and Mr. Tsang’s testimonies for lack of credibility. According to the Court of Appeal, the trial judges’  assumptions were contrary to a new “rule against ungrounded common-sense  assumptions”, which would prevent judges from making speculations based on  generalizations and common sense that are not grounded in the evidence before  them. The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judges had made errors  of law by making assumptions about human behaviour not grounded in the evidence  and that these errors had had an impact on finding Mr.  Kruk and Mr. Tsang guilty, which justified setting aside their convictions and  ordering new trials. The Crown appealed the decisions to the Supreme Court  of Canada. It argued that in both cases, the Court of Appeal should have  deferred to the trial judges’ conclusions on credibility. It also argued that their  conclusions could only be overturned if they had made “palpable and overriding  errors” in their assumptions. A “palpable” error is one that is obvious, and in  this context could include where the assumption in question is obviously  untrue, or where it is untrue or inapplicable in light of the other accepted  evidence or findings of fact in the case. If such an error has been identified,  the appeal court must also conclude that the trial judge’s reliance on the  assumption was “overriding”, meaning it affected the result or went to the core  of the outcome of the case. In the Crown’s opinion, the Court of Appeal  incorrectly relied on the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions, as  opposed to looking for palpable and overriding errors in the assumptions made  by the trial judges to justify overturning their credibility findings.  In response, Mr. Kruk and Mr. Tsang said the trial  judges were wrong to rely on ungrounded common-sense assumptions to find them  less credible. In their view, the Court of Appeal correctly used the rule  against ungrounded common-sense assumptions overturn the trial judges’  credibility findings and set aside their convictions.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeals.  <strong>The rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions should not be  recognized as a new basis for appellate courts to review credibility and  reliability findings by trial judges.</strong>Writing for a majority, Justice Martin said that adopting  a rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions would represent a radical  departure from how appellate courts have typically approached credibility and  reliability assessments, especially in the context of sexual assault. She said  the faulty use of common-sense assumptions in criminal trials should continue  to be controlled by existing standards of review and rules of evidence. In some  cases, a trial judge’s use of common sense will be vulnerable to appellate  review because it discloses recognized errors of law. Otherwise, like with  other factual findings, she said credibility and reliability assessments – and  any reliance on the common-sense assumptions inherent within them – will be  reviewable only for palpable and overriding error.In the instance cases, Justice  Martin assessed the trial judges’ credibility and reliability findings using  the standard of palpable and overriding error and concluded that no such errors  were made. For these reasons, she allowed the appeals and restored Mr. Kruk’s  and Mr. Tsang’s convictions. "
2024 SCC 6,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules that a request by police for an IP  address is a search within the meaning of section 8 of the Charter.</strong>This appeal dealt with the question of whether an  internet protocol (IP) address attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy,  such that a request by the police to obtain it constitutes a search under  section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>.  An IP address is a unique identification  number and is necessary to access the Internet. It identifies  Internet-connected activity and enables the transfer of information from one  source to another. Companies that provide access to the Internet, referred to  as Internet service providers, keep track of the user information that attaches  to each IP address. In 2017, the Calgary Police Services began an  investigation into fraudulent online purchases from a liquor store and learned  that the store’s online sales were managed by Moneris, a third-party payment  processing company. The police contacted Moneris to obtain the IP addresses  used for the transactions, and Moneris identified two. The police then obtained  an order from the court compelling the addresses’ Internet service provider to  disclose the name and residential address of the customer for each IP address.  One was registered to Mr. Bykovets, and the other to his father. The police used  this information to obtain and execute search warrants at their residences. Mr.  Bykovets was arrested and charged with offences relating to, among others, the  possession and the use of third parties’ credit cards and personal  identification documents. Before his trial began, Mr. Bykovets challenged the  police’s request to obtain the IP addresses from Moneris, alleging it violated  his right against unreasonable search and seizure under section 8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  The object of section 8 is to protect privacy, including informational privacy.  To establish a violation of his section 8 right, Mr. Bykovets first needed to  show that there had been a “search”. A search occurs where the state invades a  reasonable expectation of privacy. Mr. Bykovets argued he had such an  expectation with respect to his IP address. The trial judge found that the police’s request to  Moneris did not amount to a search because there was no reasonable expectation  of privacy in an Internet user’s IP address. She reasoned that on their own, IP  addresses do not provide a link to, or any other information about, an Internet  user. As such, Mr. Bykovets did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in  his IP address and there was no violation of his section 8 right. He was ultimately  convicted of 14 offences.    A majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal agreed with  the trial judge and dismissed Mr. Bykovet’s appeal. In dissent, one judge would  have allowed his appeal, on the basis that a reasonable expectation of privacy did  attach to the IP addresses. Mr. Bykovets appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court of Canada has allowed the appeal. <strong><em>An IP address attracts a reasonable expectation of  privacy</em>.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis explained  that if section 8 of the <em>Charter </em>was  to meaningfully protect the online privacy of Canadians in today’s overwhelmingly  digital world, it must protect their IP addresses. An IP address is the crucial  link between an Internet user and their online activity. She said “it is the  key to unlocking a user’s Internet activity and, ultimately, their identity,  such that it attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy”. Accordingly, a  request by the state – in this case, the police – for an IP address is a search  under section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. On this basis, Justice Karakatsanis allowed Mr.  Bykovet’s appeal, set aside his convictions and ordered a new trial. "
2024 SCC 5,"<strong>The Supreme  Court upholds the constitutionality of a federal statute affirming Indigenous  peoples’ right of self‑government with respect to child and family services</strong><strong>.</strong>In 2019, Parliament passed the <em>Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and  Métis children, youth and families</em> (Act), which establishes national  standards and provides Indigenous  peoples with effective control over their children’s welfare.First of all, the Act  sets out national standards and principles that establish a normative framework, which applies across the country, for  the provision of culturally appropriate child and family services. For example,  the principle of the best interests of the  child must be a paramount consideration in decisions or actions in relation to  an Indigenous child. The Act also sets out the principle of ensuring cultural  continuity, which is considered essential to the well‑being of children, families  and Indigenous groups, communities or peoples.In addition, the Act affirms the inherent right  of self‑government of Indigenous peoples that is recognized and affirmed by  section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act,  1982</em>. The Act states that this right includes jurisdiction to make laws in  relation to child and family services. For this purpose, the Act establishes a  framework within which Indigenous groups, communities or peoples can exercise  this jurisdiction.Furthermore, the Act specifies how its provisions and Indigenous  peoples’ jurisdiction to make laws in this area will interact with other laws. Section 21  gives the laws made by Indigenous groups, communities or peoples the same force  as federal laws. Lastly, section 22(3) states for greater certainty that Indigenous laws prevail over  provincial laws to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency.After the Act was passed, the Attorney General  of Quebec asked the Quebec Court of Appeal to determine whether the Act was “<em>ultra vires</em>” Parliament’s jurisdiction  under the Constitution of Canada. In other words, the Attorney General asked  whether, in light of the division of federal and provincial powers under  sections 91 and 92 of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1867</em>, Parliament had exceeded the limits of its jurisdiction by  passing the Act. In the opinion it provided in answer to that question, the  Court of Appeal concluded that the Act was constitutionally valid  except for sections 21 and 22(3), the provisions giving the laws of  Indigenous peoples priority over provincial laws.The Attorney General of Quebec and the Attorney  General of Canada both appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from that  opinion. The former argued, among other things, that the entire Act impermissibly  intruded on certain areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. The latter  countered that the Act was a valid exercise of Parliament’s legislative jurisdiction  over “Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians” under section 91(24) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>.The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal of  the Attorney General of Quebec and allowed the appeal of the Attorney General  of Canada.<strong>The  Act is not <em>ultra vires</em> Parliament’s  jurisdiction under the Constitution of Canada.</strong>In a unanimous judgment, the Supreme Court  ruled that the Act as a whole is constitutionally valid. The  essential matter addressed by the Act involves protecting the well‑being of Indigenous  children, youth and families by promoting the delivery of culturally  appropriate child and family services and, in so doing, advancing the process  of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. The Act falls squarely within  Parliament’s legislative jurisdiction under section 91(24) of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1867</em>. The  Court characterized section 21 of the Act as simply an incorporation by  reference provision. Through section 21, Parliament has validly  incorporated by reference the laws, as amended from time to time, of Indigenous  groups, communities or peoples in relation to child and family services. As for  section 22(3), the Court affirmed that it is simply a legislative  restatement of the doctrine of federal paramountcy, under which the provisions of  a federal law prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions of a  provincial law.As the Court noted, “[u]nder  this framework created by the Act, Indigenous governing bodies and the  Government of Canada will work together to remedy the harms of the past and  create a solid foundation for a renewed nation‑to‑nation relationship in the  area of child and family services”.

2024 SCC 4,"<strong>The Supreme Court rules  that mandate letters delivered by the Premier of Ontario to his cabinet  ministers are exempt from disclosure. </strong> This appeal concerned the issue of whether the public  should have access to mandate letters sent from the Premier of Ontario to his  cabinet ministers shortly after his party formed government in 2018. A journalist from the Canadian Broadcasting  Corporation (CBC) requested access to 23 mandate letters delivered by the  Ontario Premier to each of his cabinet ministers after the 2018 provincial  election. The mandate letters set out the Premier’s views on policy priorities  for the government’s term in office. The Cabinet Office declined the  journalist’s request, claiming the mandate letters were exempt from disclosure under  section 12(1) of Ontario’s <em>Freedom of  Information and Protection of Privacy Act </em>(the Act). In general, freedom of  information legislation such as this Act strikes a balance between public  disclosure and the confidentiality required by the executive to govern  effectively. Section 12(1) of the Act protects the confidentiality of records  that would reveal the substance of Cabinet’s deliberations.The CBC appealed the Cabinet Office’s decision to  Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner. The Commissioner determined  that the mandate letters were not exempt under section 12(1) and ordered their  disclosure. He found that the purpose of the Cabinet records exemption was to  promote the free and frank discussion among Cabinet members of issues coming  before them for decision, without concern for the chilling effect that might  result from disclosure of their statements or the material on which they are  deliberating. However, in his view, section 12(1) was designed to protect  deliberations occurring within Cabinet’s policy-making process, not the  outcomes of that process – the policy decisions themselves – or mere subjects  or topics of deliberation. Under his interpretation of section 12(1), the  Commissioner said the mandate letters were not exempt from disclosure because  nothing suggested they were intended to serve, or served, as the basis for  discussion by Cabinet as a whole. Moreover, rather than revealing the views,  opinions, thoughts, ideas and concerns of ministers, the Commissioner characterized  the mandate letters as the endpoint of the Premier’s formulation of the  policies and goals to be achieved by each Ministry. The Attorney General of Ontario asked the Ontario  Divisional Court to review the Commissioner’s decision. The Divisional Court  determined that the decision was reasonable. On appeal, a majority of the  Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with the Divisional Court. One judge on the  Court of Appeal dissented, finding the Commissioner’s decision unreasonable in  large part because it eroded the sphere of Cabinet privilege that section 12(1)  was designed to preserve. The Attorney General of Ontario appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.<strong>The  Commissioner’s interpretation of the Cabinet records exemption was too narrow. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis ruled the  mandate letters were protected from disclosure under section 12(1) of the Act.  She determined that the opening words of the provision mandate a substantive  analysis of the requested record to determine whether disclosure of the record  would shed light on Cabinet deliberations. A consideration of the text of the  Act, purpose, and context lead to the conclusion that the mandate letters are  protected from disclosure under section 12(1)’s opening words. The mandate  letters reflect the view of the Premier on the importance of certain policy  priorities and mark the initiation (rather than the end) of a fluid process of  policy formulation within Cabinet, and they are revealing of the substance of  Cabinet deliberations.  Justice Karakatsanis concluded: “In approaching  assertions of Cabinet confidentiality, administrative decision makers and  reviewing courts must be attentive to the vital importance of public access to  government-held information but also to Cabinet secrecy’s core purpose of  enabling effective government, and its underlying rationale of efficiency,  candour, and solidarity”.

2024 SCC 3,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a new trial must be held for 31 persons who were granted a stay of  proceedings by the Superior Court of Quebec. </strong>Following an investigation that began in 2014, a large‑scale  police operation was launched in 2016 in three regions in Quebec. Some 30 persons  were arrested and charged with various indictable offences related to  production of and trafficking in narcotics. At the time they were arrested, the accused persons were all informed  of their constitutional right, guaranteed by section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Many of them indicated that they  wanted to exercise their right as soon as they were informed of it, some did  not ask to exercise their right until they were at the police station, and the  others said that they did not wish to retain and instruct counsel or that they  had already done so. In the end, out of those who indicated a desire to exercise  this right immediately, only one was given an opportunity to do so while in the  police vehicle.The accused persons were divided  into four different groups for separate trials. Those in the first group, who  were to be tried first, filed a motion for a stay of proceedings on the basis  that there had been multiple infringements of their constitutional rights  during the police investigation and operation. In the context of a criminal  case, a stay of proceedings is a remedy that may be granted to an accused person  who establishes that the state’s conduct undermines the integrity of the  justice system, regardless of whether the person has suffered any personal prejudice  or whether the fairness of the person’s trial has been impaired. The accused  persons in this case alleged that an accumulation of infringements of their  constitutional rights, particularly their right to retain and instruct counsel  without delay, amounted to an abuse of process for all of them, even though  several of them were not the victims of any of these infringements. The accused  persons in the other three groups filed motions similar to the one filed by the  first group. The trial judge entered a stay of  proceedings for the accused persons in the first group. He found that the police  practice of postponing the exercise by the accused persons of their right to  counsel until they were taken to the police station infringed the right under section 10(b)  of the <em>Charter</em> of everyone in the  group. Relying on the cumulative effect of these infringements, which he  considered to be the most serious ones, and other infringements that occurred during  the police action, the judge found that there had been an abuse of process by  the police. A stay of proceedings was also entered for the accused persons in  the other three groups on the basis of these findings.The Quebec Court of Appeal  allowed the Crown’s appeals and ordered that a new trial be held, including a  new hearing on the motion for a stay of proceedings. In the Court of Appeal’s view,  some accused persons did not have standing to obtain a stay of proceedings,  because a remedy can be granted only to persons whose own constitutional rights  have been infringed. It was also of the opinion that the trial judge had erred  in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the accused persons without first  assessing whether the rights of each of them had been infringed. The accused  persons appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. <strong>The trial judge erred in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the accused  persons.</strong>Writing for the majority of the  Court, Justice O’Bonsawin ruled that all of the accused persons had  standing to apply for a remedy even though some of them were not the victims of  any of the infringements constituting the alleged abusive conduct.However, the trial judge had to  determine whether each accused person’s right under section 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em> had been infringed, and he did  not do so. Finally, the trial judge erred in entering a stay of proceedings for  all of the accused persons without first considering less drastic remedies that  could have fully redressed the prejudice to the integrity of the justice system  that he thought he had identified. For these reasons, Justice O’Bonsawin concluded  that this error justified holding a new trial for the first group, as well as  new hearings on the accused persons’ motion for a stay of proceedings."
2024 SCC 2,"<strong>The Supreme  Court upholds the verdict by which a former Sûreté du Québec police officer was  convicted of defrauding his employer.<em> </em></strong><strong> </strong>Nicolas Landry  became a police officer with the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) in 2001. In 2009, his  family doctor recommended that he stop working temporarily because of health  problems. His inability to work was confirmed and extended for several years. That  said, while he was off work, Mr. Landry performed a number of activities as  a manager in his former spouse’s travel agencies and travelled frequently.  In  2014, Mr. Landry met with a physician-arbitrator to have his inability to  perform his work as a police officer assessed. During that meeting, Mr. Landry  minimized his role in the travel agencies and negatively presented the state of  his psychological health in general. The SQ had information about Mr. Landry’s  activities at the travel agencies before that meeting, but it did not share it  with the physician‑arbitrator. The physician‑arbitrator found that Mr. Landry  was permanently unable to perform his duties as a police officer. The SQ did  not contest these findings. Because of his permanent disability, Mr. Landry  was entitled from then on to his full salary, including all of his  employment-related benefits, until his retirement in 2026.  Further  to the physician‑arbitrator’s report, the SQ’s professional standards division began  investigating Mr. Landry. The investigation eventually led to a formal charge  of fraud over $5,000 being laid against him.  A Court  of Québec judge convicted Mr. Landry of defrauding the SQ and sentenced  him to six months’ imprisonment. In the judge’s opinion, the Crown had proved all  the constituent elements of the offence of fraud: the commission of a dishonest  act, prejudice or risk of prejudice to the victim’s financial interests, and  subjective knowledge that the dishonest act could result in prejudice to others.  According to the judge, the material non-disclosure by Mr. Landry of the  true nature of his role within the travel agencies constituted a dishonest act.  Furthermore, Mr. Landry knew that his dishonest acts could result in financial  prejudice to the SQ, or put it at risk of prejudice, if it had to pay him his  full salary until his retirement because of his untruthful allegations.  A  majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge and  dismissed the appeal. One judge would have allowed the appeal. In her opinion,  despite the dishonest acts that Mr. Landry was accused of, he did not  cause actual prejudice or a risk of prejudice to the SQ’s interests. Because  the SQ did not contest the physician‑arbitrator’s findings and because  Mr. Landry clearly had a disability, the Sûreté du Québec was obligated to  pay him his full salary. Furthermore, given that the SQ had information about  Mr. Landry’s activities and concealed it from the physician‑arbitrator, it  could not claim that it was deceived and put at risk of prejudice. For these  reasons, the dissenting judge would have replaced the verdict of fraud with a  verdict of attempted fraud, which carries a lower sentence.   Mr. Landry  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  <strong>The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. </strong>
     As a  result, the verdict of fraud is upheld.  Justice  Karakatsanis read the majority judgment of the Court.  A print version of the  judgment that was read out will be available <a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/en/nav.do"">here</a> once finalized. "
2024 SCC 1,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  the acquittal of a Canadian military member accused of sexual assault.</strong> <em></em>
     Private D.T. Vu, a member of the Canadian military,  was charged with sexual assault for allegedly performing a sexual act on a  complainant, who was also a member of the military, without her consent after  they both attended a party and played drinking games. The complainant became  heavily intoxicated and was brought back to her room by colleagues. The accused  was then left alone with the complainant. He used his phone, angled away from  the complainant, to record her apparently consenting to the sexual act for approximately  five minutes until colleagues came back and removed him from her room. The  accused later provided a voluntary statement to the military police, in which he  stated the complainant appeared to be unconscious or asleep towards the end of  the act.  The accused was tried by a military judge in the standing  court martial. In order to find the accused guilty of sexual assault, the Crown  had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he performed the sexual act without  the complainant’s subjective consent. In cases of sexual assault, subjective  consent means the complainant had the “operating mind” to agree to the sexual  activity. To give such consent, the complainant must be capable of  understanding the physical act, that the act was sexual in nature, the specific  identity of the complainant’s partner, and that the complainant had a choice to  refuse to participate in the sexual activity. Subjective consent is different  from “apparent agreement”, or objective evidence of a complainant agreeing to a  sexual act.  The military judge found that the accused was not guilty  of sexual assault. In his view, the Crown had failed to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that the complainant was too intoxicated to consent to the  sexual act. In other words, based on the direct video evidence, the judge  thought it was possible for the complainant to have consented to the sexual act,  in which case the act would not have constituted sexual assault. For this  reason, the accused was acquitted.  The Crown appealed the acquittal to the Court Martial Appeal  Court of Canada. It argued that the military judge did not consider the  entirety of the evidence – including circumstantial evidence such as witness  testimonies and the accused’s statement to the military police – and its  cumulative effect in concluding the Crown failed to prove lack of consent.  A majority of judges dismissed the appeal and upheld  the accused’s acquittal, concluding that the military judge had properly  considered all the evidence. In dissent, one judge would have allowed the  appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial. In her view, the  military judge focused too narrowly on the video evidence, without considering  whether the circumstantial evidence corroborated it. He failed to evaluate the  evidence as a whole to determine whether the complainant was able to consent at  the time of the sexual activity. The dissenting judge concluded that based on  the cumulative assessment of the totality of the evidence before the military  judge, the only reasonable conclusion available was that the complainant had  been unable to provide subjective consent because she was severely intoxicated.  The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. <strong>The Supreme Court dismissed the  appeal. </strong>
     As such, the accused’s  acquittal was upheld.      Chief Justice Wagner read  the judgment of a majority of the Court.
